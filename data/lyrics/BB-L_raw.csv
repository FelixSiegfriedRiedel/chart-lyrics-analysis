How many chances she done gave you fuckin around with these thots? (A lot)
Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

Way too many steppers, I can't hold 'em back
Body full of scars, face full of tats

Say you want smoke, but the fire come with it
Money on your head, nigga, we'll come get it

'Partment so sweet, threw a honey bun in it
Keep it in the street, I ain't doin' no squealin'
I don't never put women in my business
Full-time rapper, I ain't doin' no drillin'
Woah, woah, I can make a M in my sleep (Straight up)

Hundred dollar three-five, a whip from D

No social security, couldn't get a license, but I still didn't complain
I went and got it, I ain't ask for no handout

You know what I'm on, first girlfriend did me wrong

Made it out the dirt, I was head first

Couldn't go to work, school was the worst
Pussy tried to play me, ayy, put him on a shirt
Lambo real fast, fell in love with cash
Fell in love with head, ayy, I fell in love with ass
Science, I was 'sleep, ayy, I fell in love with math
She was at the club, ayy, I made her take a bath
Ayy, I'm King Smoke, so I got a drum on the stick
Gang was in there, I can't put my tongue on that shit
He was talkin' crazy 'til that hollow hit his lip
Ayy, Big 4L, even the killers gettin' killed
All you see is Pateks and APs in my clique
Wе got all the bottles and the hookah in thе VIP
I might be a rapper, but it's thirty in this clip
Ayy, Zone 6, we get niggas buried 'round this bitch

Pitbull the way I walk, way I talk
Loose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', ""No opp left behind,"" nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Ain't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw
You could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw
Cut him off if he talkin' to the law
I'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw
My lil' niggas don't wanna trap, they wanna spin
Ayy, spin, fill the choppas up, then spin again
Free my dawg, he not ink, so why he in a pen'?
From Atlanta, not Vegas, but I still sin
Ayy, chain like a yo-yo, ride me like a pogo
She from out of D.C., when she fuck me, she play go-go
Used to sip lines, now a nigga sippin' Fours, though
Niggas rappin' gangsta, but they really hoes, though
Street niggas, streets don't talk, but you told, though
Rattail hangin' in the hood, boy, you bold bold
We ain't tryna hear 'bout all the bricks that you sold sold
They don't need a badge, but them niggas still the po-po
Focused on my bag, focused on my money
I done had some dark days, I done had some sunny
Niggas think they hot, I think niggas funny
Ayy, yellow baguette, VV-VVS's look like honey
All my diamonds pissed on, ayy, Andre Drummond
My playa won't even pull inside the 'partments 'cause they haunted
My dawg could've passed me the ball, but he punted
Got my turn, did a onside kick, that's how I'm comin'

Pitbull the way I walk, way I talk
Loose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork

You know either way it go, my family gon' be straight
Still in debt from all the losses that I had to take
When you out here tryna evolve, they gon' call you fake
I can't turn my back on the gang no matter what I make
I done took a lot of risks to make sure niggas ate
Superhero in my hood, I don't need a cape
I be lost sometimes, feelin' like I'm runnin' in place

Step on a nigga in some fuckin' Jordan 1s
Step on a nigga with this dirty-ass gun

It was one late night, I was cruisin' the street
We ain't had nothing to do, so we was looking for beef
Got a Glock in my hand and a stick in the Jeep
Stomping niggas 'round town, but I grew up on the East
Roll the window down, seen elbows and feet
I was kickin' up smoke, you was copping a plea
Yeah, we turned him to zaza, now his face on a tee
I be smokin' on opps, roll 'em up by the P (P)
Chopper keep shakin', the beat keep breakin'
No, I'm not a Muslim, but I don't eat bacon (Bacon)
Eyes look Asian, she say that she Jamaican
I bring her to the room, we just fucking, we ain't caking (Caking)

Steppin' on niggas, steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
Steppin' on niggas (Steppin'), steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')

Got a Glock on my hip, niggas hippity-hop
He was dissin' on songs and that shit got him shot
Hit his block with a broom, hit his block with a mop
We ain't talking to bitches, we ain't talking to cops (Fuck 12)
Check the forecast, I got galore cash
Had them killers on your step like DoorDash
Fuck your baby daddy with his dork ass
We at the bottom, nigga, show me your extort pass

Blowing gun smoke (Smoke), that's how we demonstrating ('Strating)

Used to being in my room with you

But you know my energy large, like a Quran
And you know I work too hard, I came too far
I'm happy I'm still alive

I baguetteed out my watches, I'm a timeless ass nigga
I was creepin' on the low, yeah, I'm a doggy ass nigga
But I'm an honest nigga, I can only lie when it comes to snitchin'
I hold grudges with my bitches, if you lie I won't forgive you
Just don't go tell nobody about those times that I was with you
You got my shoulder to lean on if you want to cry, fuck a tissue
In and out of love so many fucking times, I don't get it
I could get on some gangsta shit, then turn the vibe sentimental
You say you front on my nigga and he ain't ride, wrong nigga

I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

I hold on to little pieces of what we were
I know we're long gone, but take it easy
Because it hurts
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a girl with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?

If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely

If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

I beat the pussy up like a piñata
I tell her work that thing like Rihanna
Hit her from the back, she gon' call me papa
Bend it over, yeah, make it clap quick
Dunk in her pussy, yeah, I'm on that Shaq shit
So fly, post a pic with no caption
My Mexican bitch got an English accent

Uno, dos, no tres, she a thot, though
We got bitches shaking ass in the lot, though
Big chop knock a nigga out zapatos

On the dot, it never fails, you call me up (Call me up)
Talkin' 'bout you had a bad day, so you're pullin' up (Pullin' up)
So I pour up a cup of just what you need
'Cause I know what you need

I love it when you wanna sleep at my place
I love it when we dancing down the hallway
But when you leave, it puts me in a bad place
Will you stay? Come on, please stay

You come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with the goodbye
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya
I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
(It's gone too soon)
And you're sitting there with your fingertips, you're lingerin'

You ain't going nowhere
My t-shirt, you're still In it
Been on your phone for a minute
Baby, who you kiddin'?

Creeping with the girl next door
My wife was calling me (Woah, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
D.Y
Dirili-Daddy
(Dancing with you; Ozuna; let's go!)

My wife was calling me
But I didn't answer (Uah, baby; turn it up)
Because I was dancing with you
And I forgot about her (Mami)
God forgive me
I don't know why I failed her (I failed; uah)
I was dancing in the club
And I got distracted with her (Woah, oh, oh; let's go!; uah)

I was dancing in the club (Oh, oh; hah, prr)
I was dancing in the club (Eh, eh, eh; uah)
I was dancing in the club (Uah, uah; eh-eh)
I was dancing in the club

From the way she looked at me (Woah, oh, oh)
I could tell that she was what I was looking for (As she danced)
I wanted to dance with her (Woah, oh)
And for the DJ to never turn down the music
And she's having a good time (Good time)
She doesn't fall in love, she just wants to have fun (To have fun)
She is always alone, she is still self-centered (Still self-centered)
She provokes me and I fall into her game (I fall)
And she's having a good time (Good time)
She doesn't fall in love, she just wants to have fun (To have fun)
She is always alone, she is still self-centered (Still self-centered)
She provokes me and I fall into her game and it's that (Haha)
I have a problem with alcohol
I don't know why I am like this (Like this, like this)
Sometimes I think that the doctor was drinking
The day I was born (Mami, mami)
Baby, put your hands on the floor (Floor)
And play with your hair (Your hair)
Your body is pure venom (Venom)
Baby, you bring me to heaven (Baby; let's go!)
You let me fall, but she lifted me (Uah)
Please, leave me, but she lifted me (Oh, oh, oh)
And I got drunk and I forgot about you, eh (Eh), eh (Eh)
You fight a lot and I'm tired of that, eh (Eh), eh (Eh)
(Let's go; come on!)

My wife was calling me
But I didn't answer (Uah, baby; come on)
Because I was dancing with you
And I forgot about her (Mami)
God forgive me
I don't know why I failed her (I failed)
I was dancing in the club
And I got distracted with her (Woah, oh, oh; let's go!; uah)

I was dancing in the club (Oh, oh; prr)
I was dancing in the club (Eh, eh; eh, eh, eh)
I was dancing in the club (Uah, uah; eh-eh)
I was dancing in the club
(¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!)
You beat me
You got me into your game and you hurt me
I might spend my money with you
I think I am a millionaire throwing money in the air
Because you are beautiful, I flirt
So let's discuss and I never come back, that's why (Rrr!)
I want to go home with you, but you don't let me (Oh, oh, oh)
That ass is a threat, I already think you're my partner (Let's go!)
One shot (Ayy), two shots (Ayy), the problem started
Because alcohol got into my system (Prr)
Whoever tells what happened here will have problems with us
Don't blame me, blame her (Come on!)

I got distracted with you (I got distracted)
And with a couple of drinks, baby, I loosened up (I loosened up)
I stayed with you and I didn't answer him
I don't know why I failed (Yeah, yeah)
But I know what a good time I had (Ah)
Midnight arrived (Night)
We were just beginning to touch each other (Touch)
It's just that my boyfriend was waiting for me
Before twelve o'clock (Twelve)
What a good time we had last night (night)
I know I failed and he must forgive me (Eh, eh)
And if I see him again tomorrow (Ah)
I will say that he don't know me
J Balvin, man
I was dancing in the club
When I got distracted with her, yes (Woo, woo)
My wife was calling me
And I had to block her call, and (Ouch)
And I don't get carried away (Woo)
Baby, you made me fall
That booty that even a blind man can see
And even the holiest wants to be unfaithful (Leggo; yeah, yeah)

We change up the scene (Ayy)
From D.R. to Cartagena
I only feel good with you
If having you is bad, I pay my sentence, baby
We change up the scene
From D.R. to Cartagena (Come on, come on)
I only feel good with you (Leggo)
If having you is bad, I pay my sentence, yeah (Let's go!)

70,400,Ariana Grande,Ariana Grande,7 Rings,33,1,"Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag,"" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)450EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Ariana-grande-7-rings-lyrics,2019-02-02

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

So I never really knew you

Blindsided, addicted
Thought we could really do this
But really, I was foolish

Talking with my lawyer

I said, ""Young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes""

Turns into a bad dream
When running wild turns volatile
It's not funny how it changes
Ended up like strangers
And we burned down our paper house

He said that you could be mine

With the wrong people sometimes

Tavandan sular damlıyor
Bunun olacağını biliyordum, inanması yine de zor
Belki dramatik biriyim, öyle görünmek istemiyorum
Panik olmak istemiyorum

Ben üzgün bir kızım, bu koca dünyada

Lovesick girls

영원한 밤
창문 없는 방에 우릴 가둔 love (Love)
What can we say?
매번 아파도 외치는 love (Love)

다치고 망가져도 나
뭘 믿고 버티는 거야
어차피 떠나면 상처투성인
채로 미워하게 될걸
끝장을 보기 전 끝낼 순 없어
이 아픔을 기다린 것처럼

아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
But I don't care, I'll do it over and over
내 세상 속엔 너만 있으면 돼
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

No love letters, no X and O's
No love, never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone
To the left, better left alone
Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless
A prince not even on my list
Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I'm lovesick

아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
불안한 내 눈빛 속에 널 담아
아프더라도 너만 있으면 돼
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

사랑은 slippin' and fallin'
사랑은 killin' your darlin'
아프다 아물면 또 찾아오는 이 겁 없는 떨림
들리지 않아 what you say
이 아픔이 난 행복해
나를 불쌍해 하는 네가 내 눈엔 더 불쌍해

We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔없인 난 아무 의미가 없어
One, two

(Lovesick girls) 모두 결국 떠나가고

어쩜 그래서 치열하게 살았는지 모르지
But 뒤를 돌아보니 여기 우두커니 서니
나를 집어삼켜버리는 저 서슬 퍼런 그림자
여전히도 파란색 물음표는
과연 불안인지 우울인지
어쩜 정말 후회의 동물인지

여전히 모르겠어 서슬 퍼런 블루

빨라진 심장의 호흡 소릴

제발 혼자 두지 말아 줘 너무 아파

늘 걷는 길과 늘 받는 빛

무뎌진 걸까 무너진 걸까
근데 무겁긴 하다 이 쇳덩인
다가오는 회색 코뿔소
초점 없이 난 덩그러니 서있어
나답지 않아 이 순간
그냥 무섭지가 않아
난 확신이란 신 따위 안 믿어
색채 같은 말은 간지러워
넓은 회색지대가 편해
여기 수억 가지 표정의 grey

이 도시 위로 춤춘다
맑은 날엔 안개를
젖은 날엔 함께 늘
여기 모든 먼지들
위해 축배를

Oh, baby I

I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
’Cause through the morning
Oh you're the light (Oh)
And I almost lost ya
But I can't forget ya
’Cause you were the reason that I survived

You were there for me through all the times I cried
I was there for you and then I lost my mind
I know that I messed up but I promise I

I became a hero in this world
The loud screams that seek me out
My hand, trophy and a gold microphone
All day, everywhere
But all of this is about reaching you
It's the answer to my journey
I'm singing to find you
Baby to you

A little taller than I was before
With a voice a little more solid
All of this to go back to you
Now I'll spread wide a map called you
My rehab
Look at me, why can't you recognize me?
I don't want to hear other people's noises
Your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down
Let's go back to that time
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
All those roads
Are pointing to you
Everything was useless
Anything other than you
Just touch me like that time

This eternal night with no end in sight
It’s you who gifted me the morning
Now can I hold that hand?
Oh oh
I can make it right

All right
All right
Oh I can make it right
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

You are still beautiful
Just hold me silently like you did that day, that time
The reason I survived in hell
It’s for you, it was not for me
If you know, don't hesitate and please save my life
I’m thirsty wandering this desert without you
So hurry and grab me quickly
I know the sea without you is the same as a desert
All right

I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right
Everything was useless
Anything other than you

Bad Bunny, baby (Yeah)
Quizá fui muy ignorante (Yeah, eh-eh)
Y hay cosa' que no sabemos (Yeah-eh)
Quizá no puse de mi parte (No), pero tú pusiste menos
La soledad no me asusta, pero dormir solo no me gusta

Y no sé por qué nos dejamo'
Si tú me amas y yo te amo
Normal, yo sé que a vece' peleamo'
Pero qué rico cuando chingamo'
Y no sé por qué nos dejamo'
Si tú me amas y yo te amo
Normal, yo sé que a vece' peleamo'
Pero qué rico cuando chingamo'
Eh, eh, eh

(Ice)
Mami, si quiere' no' quedamo' como panas
Entre tu' mala' decisione', yo no fui una mala
Vuelve si a la felicida' le tiene' gana'
Ello' son el cabello negro y yo soy la cana
Es que tú no cambia'
Te quita' el panty y te pone' mi suéter Champion
Siempre que está' borracha, tú me llamas
Y pasa las notas en mi cama
No (Baby), no debí acostarme contigo, pero
No (No-oh-oh-oh), si te atraparon, moléstate, pero
No, no diga' que no te gustó
No diga' que no te gustó (No, oh)
No diga' que no te gustó, woh-oh

Y no sé por qué nos dejamo'
Si tú me amas y yo te amo
Normal, yo sé que a vece' peleamo'
Pero qué rico cuando chingamo'

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, te extraño to' los día', ey
Nunca supe que te perdía
Yo lo enrolaba, tú lo prendía'
Y el otro despué' que te venía' (Wuh)
Ahora la cama se me hace gigante
Nadie me da besito' pa' que me levante
Espero que el perrito los jevo' te espante (Eh, eh, eh)
No sé si fue la distancia
O tal vez culpa de mi ignorancia (Eh)
No sé si fue por mi inmadurez
Que mi nena no quiere volver (Eh)
Quizá necesitaba espacio (Eh), o ir má' despacio (Eh)
Hoy prendí pa' fumar, me puse a recordar y pensar
Y no sé por qué nos dejamos
Si tú me amas y yo te amo
Normal, yo sé que a vece' peleamo'
Pero qué rico cuando chingamo'
Y no sé por qué nos dejamo' (Oh-oh-oh)
Si tú me amas y yo te amo  (Oh, oh-oh)
Normal, yo sé que a vece' peleamo' (Oh-oh-oh)

Pero llamó a la amiga diciendo pa' janguear (Jeje), eh
Tiene un culito ahí que le acabó de textear, eh (Jah)
Pero en Bajita, ella no e' de frontear (Ey, ey)

Ella e' callaíta', pero pa'l sexo e' atrevida, yo sé
Marihuana y bebida, gozándose la vida como es (¡Wuh!)
Ella e' callaíta', pero pa'l sexo e' atrevida, yo sé
Marihuana y bebida, gozándose la vida como es

Ella no era así, ella no era así, no sé quién la dañó
Ella no era así, ella no era así, no sé quién la dañó, pero

Ahora enrola (Wuh), y lo prende (Eh)
Es panita (Wuh), del que vende (Eh), ey
Nena mala de repente (Prr-prr)
No sé si me miente
Pero sé que tiene má' de 20 (¡Wuh-huh!)
Lo' shot' de tequila ni lo' siente (Wuh)
Ahora ve la vida diferente
Buena, pero le gustan delincuente'

Ella e' callaíta', pero pa'l sexo e' atrevida, yo sé
Marihuana y bebida, gozándose la vida como es

Se dejó hace poco y tiene vida nueva (Jah)
Anda con una amiga que e' como su jeva (¡Juh!)
Que le trajo 512 pa' que se las beba
Ella es calla'íta, no e' que no se atreva

Si hay sol, hay playa, si hay playa, hay alcohol
Si hay alcohol, hay sexo, si e' contigo, mejor
Si hay sol, hay playa, si hay playa, hay alcohol
Si hay alcohol, hay sexo, si e' contigo, mejor
Quítate la ropa que hace calor
Día' de playa, noche' de terror
En la gaveta dejó el temor
Pa' las envidiosa', paz y amor
Yeh, yeh, yeh-yeh-yeh-eh
Tainy, Tainy, ey
Bad Bunny, baby, bebé

Ella e' callaíta', pero pa'l sexo e' atrevida, yo sé
Marihuana y bebida, gozándose la vida como es
Ella e' callaíta', pero pa'l sexo e' atrevida, yo sé
Marihuana y bebida, gozándose la vida como es (Eh)

Ella no era así, ella no era así, no sé quién la dañó
Ella no era así, ella no era así, no sé quién la dañó, pero

Que la noche lo pidió, el destino lo decidió
Ya sé que sentías lo mismo que yo y todavía

Sin cojone' le tiene si se enteran
Porque está casi, casi soltera
Un corillo de bandolera'
Quieren perreo la noche entera
Sin cojone' le tiene si se enteran, yeh

Yo la vi desde afuera
Tiene como a veinte en lista 'e espera
Sale pa' la calle y cojen la acera
El jevo peleando y esa no era
Un bellaqueo clandestino
Yo le meto como un submarino
Loca con los caco', pero que sean fino'
Chingó con el gato, pero no se vino
Tranquila, que yo te resuelvo
Me gusta', pero no me envuelvo
Dame eso, yo te lo devuelvo
Eh, eh, eh
Es una bichiyal
Le gusta montarse en los banshee y chillar
Se pasa pichando, pero la vo' a pillar
Ya son las die' y se empezó a maquillar
Hoy se puso traje, hoy se va a guillar
La' otra mordía', no las deja brillar
Una asesina, lo' mata con perreo
No sé cómo todavía no ha salío' en un video

Ella está casi, casi soltera (Hmm)

Realmente tuve un problema con la música de C. Tangana este año, y XXXTENTACION, Kinder Malo y Lil Peep siguen estando en mi top 5 de artistas más oídos por segundo año consecutivo; no sé cómo ""Trap Latino"" llegó a ser mi género más escuchado xdd. Además, este año me adentré bastante a la música de Rojuu, y logré subir mi número de minutos de música escuchados considerablemente.Puedes ver la imagen con mayor calidad cliqueando aquí.🔙 Trabajos anteriores al 2020 escuchados 🔙Y por último, una lista de los álbumes, mixtapes o EP que salieron antes de 2020 pero que decidí escuchar este año. He estado alejado de la música durante una época, por eso hay tantos álbumes conocidos; dejé con un ""💞"" los álbumes que más me gustaron, por si alguien quiere escuchar álbumes nuevos.

The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked

Saying you're the one for me, I need to face it

Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mom found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under

I wish the hours would go slow

Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Got the angels singing ooh-ah right now like, ooh-ah
And this is why we’ve got to touch (Ah)

Painted in your golden kiss, honey dripping from your lips

Elle a dit qu'elle a vraiment grandi pauvre comme moi
Ne croyez pas en rien mais au tout-puissant
Juste un jean et un t-shirt blanc pur
Elle n'a jamais été l femme de personne, ouais
Donc, même si je ne suis peut-être pas beau garçon, ton cœur va mal
Joue-la comme une méchante parce qu'elle est prise dans une vague
Ce soir je pars loin
Aligné dans mon esprit, sur la mouture, oui, oui

Ce soir je pourrais tomber amoureux, ça dépend de la façon dont tu me tiens
Je suis content que je sois calme, je ne peux laisser personne venir me contrôler
Continuez à danser et appelez ça de l'amour, elle se bat mais tombe lentement
Si jamais tu doutes, souviens-toi de ce que maman m'a dit

Posé comme un trophée quand Naomis entre
Elle a besoin d'un Oscar pour cette jolie peau noire
Jolie comme Lupita quand les caméras se ferment
Un égouttement a brisé la digue lorsque les Kelly sont arrivés
Je pense que ce soir elle pourrait tresser ses tresses
Melanin trop sombre pour jeter son ombre
Elle se préoccupe de ses affaires et sa taille à la taille
Or 24k, d'accord

Ce soir je pourrais tomber amoureux, ça dépend de la façon dont tu me tiens
Je suis content que je sois calme, je ne peux laisser personne venir me contrôler
Continuez à danser et appelez ça de l'amour, elle se bat mais tombe lentement
Si jamais tu doutes, souviens-toi de ce que maman m'a dit

Oh, as-tu regardé dans le miroir dernièrement? (Dernièrement)
J'espère que tu pourras échanger des yeux avec moi
Il y a des complexités dans le teint
Mais ta peau, elle brille comme des diamants
Creuse moi comme la terre, tu donnes naissance
Tout pris dans la vie, bébé, connais ta valeur
J'aime tout de toi, depuis tes boucles
À chaque courbe, ton corps naturel
La même peau qui a été brisée reste la même peau
La plupart des choses hors de propos, voir
Mais quand vous êtes dans la pièce, ils vous remarquent (vous remarquerez)
Parce que tu es belle
Ouais tu es belle

Ces hommes, ils vont tomber amoureux de toi et de toute ta gloire
Votre peau n'est pas seulement noire, elle brille et raconte votre histoire
Continuez à danser, ils ne peuvent pas vous contrôler
Ils regardent, ils vous adorent tous
En cas de doute, rappelez-vous ce que maman vous a dit

G. Ry got me
Look

Fuck rap, I'm a street legend, block love me with a deep reverence
I was birthed in a C-section
Hella cops and police presence
We got opps so we keep weapons, we on y'all block while y'all eat breakfast
A lot of shots, we broke street records
Watch how you talk, I got reflexes, watchin' your cheap necklace
Then we slide out the East exit
But every time we get to fuckin' niggas up, TMZ catch it
Y'all still learnin' street lessons?
From the mastermind, first you master grind, then your team catch it
This time it’s for the money, I don't need credit
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it, look

Fuck rap, I'm a street legend
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it
Block love me with a deep reverence (Yeah, woah)
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it (Yeah)

And I got pressure on me
Seven days a week, it's game seven on me
Life'll test you out, you live through that, that's testimony
Givin' them hell, but how in the hell I got all these blessings on me?
Most of the girls I know addicted to social media
All the time they put in, they could've wrote encyclopedias
Mama said it only takes one time to fuck up your whole Wikipedia
And as your son, I can see the type of light that you see me in
After what happened to Nipsey, I reached out to Kendrick
It wasn't even no real issues there to begin with
Lack of communication and wrong information
From people fueled by their ego, it's like mixin' flames with diesel
Energy crazy, I realized that it's a two-way street
What's comin' is goin', if it don't give you more, it drains you
Should be a billionaire based on the time off I'm not takin'
Probably why this shit with me get crazy and we lost a baby
And everybody around me think I'm the one
But we all just one of ones, and I'm walkin' out the crib
They ask me where I'm goin', I told them, ""I'm going on another ten-year run""
Niggas is bangin' over blocks that they don't own, thinkin' that's home
Boy, you think that's where you from? You don't really know where you from
You don't how deep your roots is or what your ancestors had done
So, God bless all of the sons and daughters
Who knew they history so they knew where to take it farther
And all the ones that stuck with me like good barbers
Lookin' at my life story, God's a good author
Never was the loudest in the room, we move like ninjas
And if it cost your peace of mind, it might be too expensive
So I can't give you everything that you want from me for free though
Get you one shot in life, you might not be able to reload
So advanced, I need all my advances
Bro hit me up for cash like we didn't have the same chances
My dad hit me up like, ""Why I don't live in a mansion?""
I'm tryna focus, but baby girl keep holdin' my mind for ransom
And that ain't how it supposed to be, this man Hov got to a B
And his name Shawn too, I almost felt like it was me
Damn, I realized all my setbacks were inside of me
In high school, I learned chemistry, biology
But not how to cope with anxiety
Or how I could feel like I'm by myself on an island
With depression on all sides of me (Damn)
With a Glock seventeen right on the side of me (Hol' up)
Look, I ain't think I had the thought of suicide in me
Until life showed me all these different sides of me
Too many times I thought the reaper was outside for me (Ooh)
And how the fuck it's people that never met me that hate me?
I wonder if they understand that I meditate daily
And feel like my life purpose is to give inspiration
Despite the hit songs that there's just no escapin'
That I take care of my family and beat the odds that were deadly
You hate that, that just reflects your lack of succession, bless 'em
If it ain't Nipsey blue, it's Detroit blue
This that Detroit 2, I'm bringin' it back to my hood like d-boys do
Gone (Gone)
So, the collaboration though, with Nipsey and who?
Aw man, I'd probably say Payroll, eh, or Tee Grizzley
Me and Big Sean talked about doin' somethin' recently, too
So, you know, all of them, I'ma, I'ma tap in with all of Detroit
Fuck rap, I'm a street legend

Don't ask questions you don't wanna know

Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna

To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals

Pretty cool... right?

But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

Better off without them

Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke

On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god

Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

On your cigarette break

195,1458,Blake Shelton,Blake Shelton,God's Country,23,17,"Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
(This is God's country)
God's country

I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light)
Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah)
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound

In my mind has faded
The blue sky over Telluride
Next to you's kinda overrated
The winding road, let it twist
My home's wherever your heart is

Never felt the chill of a pew when you lost faith
Well, blood, sweat, and tears wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't strike out a couple hundred times
If you never hit rock bottom, never cussed the sky
You would've never known to ask the good Lord why
Or ever changed your life

If you never had hard days
If you never had a heartbreak
Never had more than you can take
Or carried the weight
Of life on your shoulders
Would you feel like you earned it?
Would you live with a purpose?
Or ever known your own strength
If you never had hard days?

You wouldn't know what it's like to dance in the rain
Never see the silver lining when the skies go gray
You wouldn't know a dream come true from a few that don't
You'd never find your way on a broken road
If you never had hard days
If you never had a heartbreak
Never had more than you can take
Or carried the weight
Of life on your shoulders
Would you feel like you earned it?
Would you live with a purpose?
Or ever known your own strength
If you never had, if you never had

The downs and scuffs, the scars, the ruts
And all you put behind you
When the wins, the ups, the rise aboves
Are right there to remind you

If you never had hard days
If you never had a heartbreak
Never had more than you can take
Or carried the weight
Of life on your shoulders
Would it feel like you earned it?
Would you live with a purpose?
Or ever known your own strength

214,9347,Bryson Tiller Featuring Drake,Bryson Tiller,Outta Time,1,48,"I've been thinkin' maybe
Things were never the
Way we made 'em out to be
How we thought they were
Lately, I'm not sure
One thing for sure
Is when we're together
We're toxic as ever
Make no mistake, all the roads lead
To we shouldn't be together

I don't know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
Been twisted off you so long, oh-ho
'Cause it's complicated, far from simple
Always find a way to dodge thеse issues
Can't seem to shake it, not for nothing
Thе problem is we're not discussin'
All that screaming, yelling's not becomin' of you
Things just can't be fixed, we're out of time

Time, oh yeah
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh, turns out I don't
Know, know you, no, not anymore, no
And I can't wait 'til we find a way to part ways
Seems like your days are dark days
Seems like you're mad at the small things, I
Admit it, it seems like you're playin' it the hard way
We fight through the night, all day

I, I still don't know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
I've been twisted on you for so long
For so long, girl (Yeah, yeah)
Got me twisted, I could only wait for so long
For so long, girl (For so long)
Waited so long, but we got no time, no

Ooh, babe
Woah, oh
Woah, oh no
Ooh, babe

Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences
No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

Yeah, loving you114EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-consequences-lyrics,2019-01-05

I’ll see you in the mornin'
No, of course he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh, you’ll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time

No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waitin' outside

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you’ll stay up late just waitin’ for me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me

Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I’ve got eight days off comin' up
And I can only come home for four
Yeah, I just met his family
They're just like you and mom (Oh)
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he’d never hurt me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway, faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah

And before they open up the doors
I say, ""I've never seen you cry before""
You say, ""You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl""
You're looking at me while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me

I said ""I don't love you"" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted

Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now
I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
So I hope you're happy now

230,7096,Carrie Underwood,Carrie Underwood,Drinking Alone,7,74,"(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should

We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone
I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Drinking alone, drinking alone) together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

We should be drinking alone

Her baby won't be coming home tonight
Sirens screaming down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa
Politics and prejudice
How the hell'd it'd ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no
And so it goes, but I hold onto hope and I won't let go 'cause

I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

Sometimes it takes a lot of faith
To keep believing there will come a day
When the tears and the sadness, the pain and the hate
The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah

I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins
Love is power, love is a smile
Love reaches out, love is the remedy
Love is the answer, love's an open door
Love is the only thing worth fighting for, yeah

I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand

People dressed like they're in Panama
Small town, spring break
Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around

To get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound

Bo got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow
'Cause she's dancin' on the dock and it's only 2 o'clock
Yeah, the fish ain't bitin' 'cause the party's on
The old men are thinkin' 'bout goin' home
But those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
We're gonna get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
Woo!

Yeah, we got the rope swing swingin' like a chandelier
Little bit of heaven on the water ride here
Don't need much, just a couple of beers and you and me
Gotta love this time of year
Getting southbound, southbound

So let's get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down

Let the candles light the night up from the windowsills
Ooh, as I draw you near
And we whisper all the sweet sounds only we can hear
On the coldest evening in this December
I hold you in the heat of the glowing embers

Let the world stand still, the church bells ring
Silent night as the angels sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let the magic warm the moonlit air
Hear the choirs join in singing everywherе
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Ooh, let thеre be peace on earth
Let the lonely join together, let them know their worth
Ooh, let the children know
There's a brighter day ahead, let's hold on to hope
And on the coldest evening in this December
Let us pray the spirit of love will linger

Oh, let the world stand still, the church bells ring
Silent night as the angels sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let the magic warm the moonlit air
Hear the choirs join in singing everywhere
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, glory I'm so glad to have you here
And may this Christmas moment last for years

Silent night as the angels sing

236,3194,Chance The Rapper Featuring Death Cab For Cutie,Chance The Rapper,Do You Remember,1,95,"Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the ""27 Club""
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever? (Summer everlasting)

If you blink you might miss it
You gotta click it or ticket
You gotta go get the gettin' before it's gone
End it quickly as it begun
Life is short as a midget, but mine's a little LeBron
Been a minute since Eminem was a blonde
I need a peace prize‚ mom invented the bomb
A nigga wanted more‚ I would only sit on the lawn
A nigga up next like strongly scented colognes
I'm 'bout to book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome
I still could hit up Sony today and get a loan
And shout out to Miss Sylvia Rhone‚ we get along
But that boy advance gotta be bigger than Diddy Kong
I need stock and it gotta be Pippi Long
Can't stop, won't stop boppin' like Diddy's song
My next tour got eight legs like daddy long
I'm 'bout to have two kids that like daddy's song

Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a ""Mrs."" today

Backyard blasted, dance 'til it's grassless
Patio glass, the mazel tov cocktails
Bomb, b-bombastic, used to drop acid
Marli come soon, I only drop classics
Everyone ask
""When that heat gon' drop?""
""When that knee gon' drop?""
""When is he gon' pop the question we all got?""
""'Cause this could be y'all block
You're livin' in a glass house, we can see y'all clocks""
But I can see you from the other side, see y'all rocks
And we could've been Magneto, if you seen our locks
But we share it with the world, not just fans
Come out clean lookin' like we jumped the broom and the dustpan
So now it's here and we actin' out
Dame Dash, champagne in the back of Tao
Now I'm back in my bag and the cat is out
Burn a hole in my pocket like a Black & Mild (Igh)
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody (Oh, I...)

You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall

Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, ""Hi""? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time

Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity
Don't check on me
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try

Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason

But I don't think she can understand
Just how far I’ve been lettin' my heart fall

Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight

In my beat-up car, with the windows down

And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""

Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare

Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

You know I'll do anything you ask me to
But, oh my God, I think I'm in love with you
Standing here alone now
Think that we can drive around
I just wanna say
How I love you with your hair down
Baby, you don't gotta fight
I'll be here 'til the end of time
Wishing that you were mine
Pull you in, it's alright

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
Honey, I don't want it to fade
There's things that I know could get in the way
I don't want to say goodbye
And I think that we could do it if we tried

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine

All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done

Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you

Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile
I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you


Yeah, every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge

Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

Gettin' over me, and man it ain't pretty, no

But if I could, man I would

That me and Tennessee want her back
I wish it worked like that

You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew, how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
(Wish I were Heather)

Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay

Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder
Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby
Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day, he'll grow up and be a man
And lately, you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see, I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slippin' at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillan en la luz son los que me fascinan

They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

Look, look

A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view

Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race

Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country

Bitches call me a cutie, I'm groovy
My daughter took care of forever off music (Muah)
Screaming, ""Fly high,"" to Kobe, Gianna, we ballin'
I can't tell you shit about losin' (R.I.P.)
Finger fuck allegations, keep hatin'
I'm patiently waitin' on niggas to prove it (You bitch)
Bitch, you know I turn piss into lemonade
Turn shit into sugar, that's chocolate pudding
Let you know I don't fuck with you anyway (Hmmgh)
Know I keep getting better, you thought that I wouldn't
I'ma keep lettin' off, I'm a renegade
The media blitzed and I took off and shook 'em
Came out like a boss and they feel a way (Ha)
Gon' end up gettin' fucked, you keep thinkin' I'm pussy
Bitch, I'm 'bout my business, it's all about timin'
When I put this shit on, I don't cop from no stylist
I'm all on the TV and net, I'm too viral
I pull up with a vibe, when we hop out, we vibin'
I like movin' in silence, don't bother nobody
He come bother me, I'ma catch me a body
I don't get into politics, I just be poppin' shit
Obviously hot as a motherfuckin' fire (Hot)
Let me cool off a minute
I got nothin' to hide, I don't run from my problems
Just tryna get you out my business (You bitch)
Only answer to God, I'm already convicted
If I'm havin' you as my witness (Uh-huh)
Having hoes at my shows, tryna take off they clothes

All these icy VVS on my neck, let's play hockey (Bling, bling)
I'm guessin' that he brought a stick, 'cause I brought a stick (Yeah)
And I ain't the type to be payin' for pussy
I fuck hoes for free, never bought a bitch
Hold me up to the sun, I'm not counterfeit (Yeah, yeah)
I just got a new gun from my bottom bitch
And I'm ready to slang it, I'm armed and I'm dangerous (Boom, boom, boom)
Come fuckin' with me, better find a ditch
And throw yourself in it 'cause that's how I'm living
When I get in my feelings, I make niggas feel it
When I hit yo lil' bitch, I put dick in her kidneys
On a date with my new ho, I took her to Wendy's
We ain't going in, get that shit from the window
Take that ho through the drive-thru
Keep playin' me like a ho, we gon' slide through

They goin' crazy when they play it, head bobbin' and shit
And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami
I was out there with the family
Just lookin' at my daughter
Thinkin' to myself like, ""Damn, my baby look just like my daddy""
Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up
That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick
Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch
And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click
I'm tryna send somebody wit' him
Somebody let me know what's happenin'

You know how I rock behind my daddy
You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family
How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?
How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?
I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'

And I still got a lotta shit on my mind that I can't undecide (Yeah, yeah)

You know I ever catch you with a nigga, gettin' beat up
You know when you was cold, I came through and helped you heat up

Got me feelin' like the Prince if he lost Cinderella
Fuck a glass slipper

You ever seen a nigga get slapped with a pistol?

Looking for the truth? You found a nigga
Thought I was a one hit wonder 'til I dropped the album, didn't it?
Thought I was just like you 'til I bought a new car
Pull up in that bitch, like vroom
And I dropped your boo off
You'll probably pick her up later
I probably pick up a quarter million and shit on a hater
And it ain't a nigga gave me shit, but I did plenty of favors
I'm talking favors

Passin' out these loans that I don't want back (Yeah, yeah)

Look, I ain't nothing like your last nigga, you buggin', I run it up
Had to stack my bread up, I was sick of feelin' regular
Niggas out here drillin' her and you worried about impressin' her (Yeah)

Feel like a workout, don't it? (Uh-huh)

This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey (Nipsey, yeah)
Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty (Empty, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And everybody wonderin' why he come around and don't say nothin'
'Cause it been so long, it been so long
I came from nothin'

Lemme pop my shit
I came from shit, three of us and my mom, she couldn't pay rent
Two jobs, all alone, she couldn't quit
We was home alone when we was jits
That was before I was grown, before I was on
I ain't had no shoes, I ain't had no clothes
Lemme wear your shoes, lemme fuck your bitch
I ain't had no car, I ain't had no whip
Wonder why a nigga cover his ears when y'all talk
'Cause it ain't nobody could tell me shit
I spent 30K on my daughter birthday, everybody had fun
Nigga, everybody lit
When a nigga go home, I don't answer my phone
Everybody want to leech, everybody want a loan
Everybody wanna talk, everybody wanna clique
I don't wanna be friends and get off my dick
I ain't had time to think, I ain't had time to breathe
I've been prayin' to the Lord, I've been talkin' on my knees
I been thinkin' 'bout my pops, I been thinkin' about my opps
Thinkin' how can I stop me a nigga when he breathin'
When a nigga play with me, I ain't lookin' for my phone
I ain't finna drive away, I ain't lookin' for my keys
The fuck these niggas know about me?

And you ran in my place
Shoes too big, but they use hair strands as a lace, and they break
When it's hot outside, you don't want fans in your face (Ah)
But you might want a fan in your face
When yo' man got a heat and the hand in the waist (Band)
Gotta keep a cool head, niggas got PTSD these days (Yeah)
Some folks ain't live to see these days (Yeah)
I be in the lab like Dex, coolin', takin' these Dee Dee breaks (Long)

Don't make me push the button
Full of pain, droppеd enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a 100, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama
She hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son
Was always guaranteed to get the money (okay, let's go)

And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
You fool me one time, you can't cross me again
1200 horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, 30 thousand, thought it was my last day

To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight

I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay

And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said ""Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough""
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest

Some days you're livin'

Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're living
It'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

No entienden que la bolsa está hablando, soy extranjera
Cuando piensan que superarán a la reina, comienzan a caer
Palabras a mis tiros de culo soy tan descarada
Los tengo tratando de golpear mi trasero como la joven Keke
Sí, soy ghetto, palabras para Gepetto
Además, soy pequeña, ¿dónde están mis zapatos?
Dile a Mike Jordan, envíame mis Retros
Solía ​​ser bi, pero ahora solo soy hetero
No estoy hablando de medicina, pero lo hice morfina
Desde que puse mi vagina en cuarentena
Él conoce esta cosa ""A1"" como un delito grave
Todo lo que tiene que hacer es decir la palabra como un concurso de ortografía

I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust

It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you""

I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done

By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?

And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?

You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now

My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?""
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?

Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention
Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Drake-deep-pockets-lyrics,2020-05-16

I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
They never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled ""Surprise!"", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga

Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympias
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga

This song I've been writing, oh, for a few months
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)

Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
You got some liquor at the house?
Yeah
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
I don't see it
Okay, hahaha

Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
Yes, sir

Hold on, hold on

I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater

Can't describe the pressure I be puttin' on myself, yeah
Really, I just can't afford to lose nobody else, yeah
If they movin' shaky, we'll just do this shit ourselves, woah
If I'm movin' shaky, Chubbs'll do this shit himself, yeah
Solo niggas, only YOLO, for real
Heard a lot about you but we don't know for real
Next time, guarantee the truth'll get revealed

Black leather gloves, no sequins, yeah

Got a dance, but it's really on some street shit

Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

Woi-oi
Ayy

I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
""Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?""
(June, you're a genius)
I said, ""I respect it, no problem""
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real

Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, ""Damn, coach, put him in""
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when

Porque tienes deseos, lo sé, lo sé, lo sé (Hey)
Porque tienes deseos

Tienes ese fuego y no soy un mentiroso
Me pusiste de rodillas todos los días, tuve que hablar con el Mesías
Estoy en un 8 y un 1 y 2, este es un Ferrari diferente, sí
Traté de pagar todos tus préstamos y conseguirte un conductor, sí
Te hice quedarte demasiado cerca de la ciudad, actúas demasiado vulnerable viviendo esta vida
Debería haberte alejado de Houston antes de que te recogiera todo este hielo
Quieres ser mi número uno, no estás actuando como lo principal
Te dejé tocar mi número dos, apenas conseguiste la segunda cuerda

Debería haberte dejado en un lugar donde nadie podría encontrarte (Encontrarte)

Ayy, el auto-control nunca ha sido lo tuyo
No creo que ayude si hay un anillo con una roca dentro
De donde soy ellos sirven, el refresco brilla (Brilla, brilla, brilla)
Vienes de una ciudad donde hay inclinación con las rocas
¿Cómo diablos guardas tantos secretos?
¿Cómo te vuelves vegana, pero aún sigues conmigo?
¿Como mierda has visto tantas playas?
Los boletos para los lugares no son baratos
Y te veo de vuelta en Turcas
Recuerda quién te llevó allí primero y no lo olvides
Te tengo un látigo y luego te vuelves loca
Tuve que decirle a Eric que fuera a buscarlo
Siempre me muevo demasiado rápido, la sensación no dura
Siento que me das por sentado
Probablemente es mi culpa por la forma en que lo manejé

Debería haberte dejado en un lugar donde nadie pudiera encontrarte

¿Por qué lo harías tan audaz en mi cara?
¿Por qué tus historias están por todos lados?
Muchos secretos que los amigos no guardan
¿A dónde fueron todos tus amigos? (Woo)
No puedo resolver tus problemas
Dices que tus problemas nunca necesitaron solución

Ey, del camión al avión, al camión
Del camión al pasillo del hotel
Yo paseo por garajes subterráneos
Con un suite presidencial en el depósito
Y un ascensor hasta la habitación
Nos duchamos y luego vamos al club
Llego y tengo que ver qué ocurre
Con el código de área de mi teléfono
¿Qué números sigo teniendo?
¿A quién conozco del pasado?
Hablo con una, y ella dice que tiene un hombre
Hablo con otra, aparece verde
Debe haber cambiado de teléfono al equipo
¿Recuerdas cuando me llevabas por el buen camino?
Eso fue en 2017
Todo está bien, Chubbs mirará alrededor
Encuentra a alguien que sea de mi tipo
Ese es mi socio y él sabe lo que me gusta
Él encontró mucho en mi vida
El problema es que me veré con una chica esta noche
Y la trataré demasiado bien
Pasos de tarjetas de crédito en el Galleria
Sin siquiera saber si está casada
Pero sí sé una cosa
Las mujeres vienen y van
De sábado a domingo, y lunes
De lunes a domingo
Tal vez te amaré algún día
Tal vez algún día maduremos
Hasta entonces me sentaré borracho en esa pista

Hay joyas en la caja fuerte a la llegada
J lleva una pistola para sobrevivir
Mucha gente lucha por el título
Mucha gente trata de aprovecharse
Pero yo sólo estoy tratando de pasar una buena noche
El camarero trajo el cheque de la comida
Ella dijo, ""Cariño, creo que hubo un error""
No, chica, yo lo pago, no es nada
Podría mostrarte cosas más grandes que eso
En un minuto regreso
Déjame mostrarte imágenes que sí duran
AMEX tenía un límite en el pasado
Tuve muchas mujeres en el pasado
Pequé mucho en el pasado
No necesitas saberlo, pero puedes preguntar
Apegada a tu pase tras bastidores
Tienes todo el acceso porque eres mala
Podrías ir a donde sea con ese culo
Del concierto a la ducha, al camión
Del camión al club, para la fiesta
Entras primero con tus amigas
Porque no sé quién está afuera mirando
Pero sí sé una cosa
Las mujeres vienen y van
De sábado a domingo, y lunes
De lunes a domingo
Tal vez te amaré algún día
Tal vez algún día maduremos
Hasta entonces me sentaré borracho en esa pista

Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react

Эй

Эй
Ниггеры могут не уважать
Но ниггерам придётся принять
Ведь вся моя музыка идёт прямо из сердца
Люблю своих парней до смерти (Кодеин)
Hype Williams, Lil' X
И если ты не говоришь это своим корешам прямо
То о тебе никто не позаботится, эй, йеа, йеа

Я положил немного брюликов ей в руку
Я позволил взять ей аванс
Всё пошло не так, как я планировал
Затолкал её в машину
Ей придётся покататься со своим другом
Слышал, что она вернулась к своему прошлому парню
Да мне похуй, эй
Разъезжаю на Гелике по шоссе, ты знаешь меня
Когда я захожу в игру, я словно Kawhi, сметаю всё на пути
Я и lil' Sicko сидим рядом, пересчитываем бабки
Раньше я был интровертом, теперь завожу друзей
Только что купил себе особняк в Turks, он стоит прямо напротив моря (Окей)
Если она приведёт четырёх подруг, то одной я точно займусь лично (Окей, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt)
Эти крошки танцуют для меня у бассейна, они все намокли (Окей)
Полиция в моём городе, мужик, со мной их карманы не будут пустыми (Окей)
Мы с капо пытаемся оставить след в истории и принести мир на восточное побережье
Пусть никто больше не наваривается на бифах (Окей)
Но я могу устроить биф с любым рэпером, я всегда на взводе
Эта детка приехала из Мексики, и она знает, что она - сладкая штучка
Эй (Бип, бип, бип)
Ниггеры могут не уважать
Но ниггерам придётся принять (Принять)
Ведь вся моя музыка идёт прямо из сердца (Принять)
Люблю своих парней до смерти (Кодеин)
Hype Williams, Lil’ X (Бип)
И если ты не говоришь это своим корешам прямо (Бип)
То о тебе никто не позаботится, эй, йеа, йеа

Тысячи долларов в карманах моих джинсов от Raf Simons (Тысячи в джинсах, окей)
Бриллианты на зубах, я звоню дантисту, йеа (Окей)
У меня сумка от Goyard, храню все бабки там (Все бабки, йеа)
Каждый раз, как приезжаю домой, ты знаешь, я сажусь за руль Бентли (Йеа, йеа, йеа)
Только что закинул таблетки себе в стакан, йеа, йеа (Только что закинул таблетки, ах)
Детка приехала ко мне просто для того, чтобы я её трахнул (Детка приехала ко мне)
Но я хочу только минет, йеа, только его (Хочу только минет)
И я знаю, что я уже на вершине, но я хочу большего (Окей)
Помню, как спал на полу (Помню, оу йеа)
Теперь я каждый день пахну Christian Dior (Окей, Yohji)
Теперь я каждый день напиваюсь (Лин, лин, лин, лин)
Теперь я каждый день напиваюсь (Лин, лин, лин, лин, окей)
Потратил сотню тысяч баксов за последнюю ночь в Нью-Йорке (Йеа, йеа)
Потратил сотню и на следующий день, мне было скучно (Окей, окей, йеа)
Эта Ламба набирает скорость за секунды (Окей, понял)
Йеа, она продолжает мне написывать, а я игнорю (Йеа, йеа, йеа, йеа)
Йеа (Оу, йеа, йеа, йеа)
Эй

Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)
When I die, put my money in the grave

A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy

Potato over my gun
I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, ""Rip,"" and they missin' you

Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God

Christmas carols by candlelight

Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home

You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow

But you know I fuckin' love her now

Pew, kung pow, hit your ass with a cross kick
Pulling hair out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC

371,2956,Ed Sheeran Featuring Eminem & 50 Cent,Ed Sheeran,Remember The Name,1,57,"Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)
I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no ""if,"" ""ands,"" or ""buts"" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town the next day
But love ain't
And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't

Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

Sad movies are for crying on the couch there in the dark
That sad song it was written just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't

Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate

'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

I wonder what he's doing
(Love ain't)
Feeling like a fool

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze
One little taste, it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)
That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness, my old friend)
But what if nobody shows? Panic mode
'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
The press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore (Hello, darkness, my old friend)

People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note, just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

I'll fuck around and pile еight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
I'll await my trial date 'til then (What?)
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (Nah), mic, pencil get killed (Yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (Chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (Haha, yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (Yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (Fight in the dog)
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or nah? (Nah)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (Straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause
They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID; what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat; yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (You took a bite off of that; damn)

And d.a. got that dope he sends to me (Uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (What?), that's social distancing (Yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (Shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the fuck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (Face mask)
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (Damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem
Like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this nightmare will end (Marilyn)? Like Monroe, Norma Jean (Norma Jean)
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (Dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (Nope)
For some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (Yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air (Mmm)
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (Woah)
I got a contact like eyewear (Woah)
Wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (Uh)
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.​
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault (A salt)
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (Dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

But we're in two different worlds and (Yeah)
I'm not your husband (Nah), you ain't my girlfriend
All I know is that (What?)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (Yeah)
Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say, ""This is me without you""
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is

I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, ""Let's meet around three""
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, ""Where the fuck you've been?""
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are getting super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't overhear us talk
'Cause we both are getting sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
Of each other being someone else's
Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish
But I just wanna see ya
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it
Yeah, I'm open season
And I'm always game, so I keep it a hundred, dear, haha
'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because

I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him

Ha, I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me
To feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles
Of pills, think your boy is startin'
To feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
But the word ""fucking"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is, ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Ho thinks her snatch is magical
But that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact, it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital B out the back window
Of the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'll be great, but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisibl Skratch Piklz
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a Louisville slugger and crapped it
I'd like to introduce myself

My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial
Extra, extra, extraterrestrial (Skrrt, yeah)

I could keep beefin', fuck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in Hell, but I should get Puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said give you an L, inhale
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growing up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
""Oh, what a bundle of joy""
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head, say it's still a dream
Then he said kill emcees
Trippie Redd, with pills and lean
Sipping meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine
My name’s Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial (Yeah)
Extra, extra, extraterrestrial

I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)
Eat you pussies like cunnilingus (Like cunnilingus)
There ain't no stoppin' it (There ain't no stoppin' it)

You wanna butt heads? Shut up, Beavis, haha
I got your bitch with her butt out
I'm hittin' a lick 'cause she stickin' her tongue out (Bitch)
You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
She 'bout to give up the dugout (Yeah)
I should just live in a nuthouse
Right now, I live in an igloo (Yeah)
And I'm not chillin' the fuck out
Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and
Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man
I'm a stan of Redman, X-Clan and I'm a Treach fan
But I look up to myself (Yeah)
Like a fucking headstand (Yeah)

So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
But it's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by

Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die

(This a song about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, it’s probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)
Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I'd cry
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
Then Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this is why I...
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

So this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, ""Oops"" and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""Fuck you, punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)

Evet, eski beni özlüyorlar
Bence benim yeniden kodein yüzünden aşırı doz olmamı istiyorlar
Hayatımın 2003'teki gibi gürültü patırtılı olmasını istiyorlar
Onlar en ön sıraları istiyorlar, ben onlara burun kanaması veriyorum
İçimde patlamamı, havaya uçmamı, kendimden nefret etmemi, tükenmemi istiyorlar
Onlara bağırıyorum şuana kadar hiçbir pişmanlığım yok ve zor lokmayım
Kıyafetlerimi parçalıyorum
Doktoru görmek zorundayım Kool Moe Dee gibi (Evet)
Dre'yi ikna etmek hiç fazla zaman almadı
Ten rengine saplantılı biri değildi
İlk günden beri, ustanın ikiz bıçaklı sorun çıkarıcısı
Vazgeç, anlamıyorsun (Woo)
Zayıf beyin, muhtemelen zarından sikilmiş
Slim Sha- tam bir sapık, ama deli
Kalem oyunu bu sanki son bölümde takılı kaldım (Haykırıyorum pişman değilim diye)
Evet, uçlarda yaşıyorum, çıkıntının kenarında oturuyorum
Tam kafana sıçmak için, banka oturdum
Affetmek ve unutmak pişman olabileceğim tek şey
Düşmanca eylemlere cehennem gibiyim, beni ölüme terk ettin
Mezarımdan sürünerek geldim, hazır olsan iyi edersin

Tüm bu nefret, nereden geldiğini tam olarak söyleyemediğim
Ama işte yeniden oluyor he?
Hepiniz beni köşeye sıkıştırmıştınız
Şimdi hepiniz beni destekliyorsunuz
Şimdi seyirci kalan masumlardan bazılarına dalacağım
Bazı düşmanlar için büyük silahlar taşıyorum
Bazı hedefler ölüm vuruşumun tadını alacaklar
Bazılarının ise adını bile zar zor anıyorum
Bir hata yapabilirim ve patlayabilirim elim bomboş bitirebilirim
Ya da saçma sapan konuşur, işi yürüttüğümü sanarım
Öfkemi yanlış yönlendirip Earl'e ve vasat Tyler, The Creator'a gönderebilirim
Asla bunlara cevap vermemeliydim, sadece çakmaları hedeflemeliydim
Hain serseriler, çünkü yılanlar amcıktır
Bir kerede sekiz yüz vibratörü içlerine alabilirler
Ve ölmeye yaklaşmış olan herkes için
Arose'u ağlamadan dinleyemeyenler için
Dibi boylarmışçasına en dipte hissedenler için
Ama bu şarkı sadece ilham verdiklerim için
Tabanca kılıfından çıktı mı patlar
Niyetimi gördüklerinde düşmanlar bir dağ aslanının eline düşmüş gibi hissedecek
Kızım hakkında konuşuyorlar, umarım kendimi kontrol edebilirim
Çünkü aklıma ilk gelen şey bin kıta yazıp ağızlarına sıçmak
Ama bu bazen iskambil kağıdından yapılmış bir evin üstüne örs bırakmak gibi
Ya da Godzilla savaş botlarıyla kızarmış ekmek parçası eziyor gibi
Ya da lanet olası bir atom bombasını bir karınca yuvasının üstüne bırakıyormuşum gibi
(Haykırıyorum, pişman değilim) Hayır, yapamam
En zor yeri geçtin, egosu şişik, seni bir star yaptım (Haykırıyorum pişman değilim diye)

389,5630,Eminem Featuring Ed Sheeran,Eminem,Those Kinda Nights,2,31,"Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
It's one of those kinda nights

Yes, this beat’s takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
And takin’ her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like ""Goddamn""
She's like ""That's harassment,"" I'm like ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That’s the best ass I’ve seen in a while
We should be datin', she’s from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (Since an addy)
She said ""Fuck off"" and threw her liquor at me
It’s one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights
This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her et cetera
Had her like, ""Oh my God
My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""
I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?""
She said, ""No, I'm bi""
She said, ""Are you drunk?,"" I said, ""No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick,"" she said, ""So am I""
""What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at?""
She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""
Then I said

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda—
OMG
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Said she wants to go with me
I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said, ""Out""
I said, ""I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me""
Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes Da Brigade
Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, ""Let's pull over,"" she said, ""No problemo""
Windows are dark tint, roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi, I'm comin', you're goin'

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise

Haan.. haa haa

391,5602,Eminem Featuring Juice WRLD,Eminem,Godzilla,20,3,"Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

Look what I'm plannin', hahaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Eminem-juice-wrld-godzilla-lyrics,2020-02-01

Tüm bu güzel kaltaklar seni yakıp kül edip edecek
Elinde kalan son şeyi satma, kazanmaya devam etsen iyi edersin
Ama yarını görebilmen için dua edeceğim küçük adam, öğreneceksin

Ben yoksulluktan yara almamış bir şekilde çıkan bir ürünüm
Olası bir monopoli için bunca mülkü aşıracağım ve takas edebilmek için faydalanabilirim
Babamın dünya görüşünü benimsememeye çalışıyorum
Aynı zamanda kolonoskopisinde her şeyin yolunda gitmesi için Tanrı'ya dua ediyorum
Cambaz ipinde intihara meyilli bir şekilde yürüyorum
Bu sırada şeytanlar beni ele geçirmeye çalışıyor
Karıcığım bir yandan beni vazgeçirmeye çalışıyor
O olmasaydı, zihinsel olarak tamamlanmamış hissederdim, o benim için yaratılmış
96'dan beri yanımda, metreslerimin korkulu rüyası, bazı şeyler olması gerektiği gibi
Hayatla uğraş
Bu benim için, benim yerime kızlarımı öp
Buna şan şöhret diyorsunuz, ben ise alkolün getirdiği rezillik
Çocuklarımı ve bebeklerimi nüfusun ve silah kontrolünün arasından çekip alıyorum
Bu boktan şeyler bunun yüzde yüz fazlasını yapmam gerekmesine yol açıyor
Yobaz ırkçıları rahatsız ediyorum
Eğer oturup konuşmaya ve yaraları onarmaya karşıysanız, o zaman ayrımcılığa karşı değilim
Beyaz ve ayrıcalıklı politikacılar bunun ayrımcılıktan ne farkı olduğunu sorsa da, bu komik kardeşim
Bu ayrışma yolumun nereye varacağını anlatıyor
Ayrımcılık uyandı ve ben nereye gitmek istersem oraya gidiyor
Dua et, yarını göreceksin küçük adam, öğreneceksin
Tüm bu güzel kaltaklar seni yakıp kül edip edecek
Elinde kalan son şeyi satma, kazanmaya devam etsen iyi edersin
Ama yarını görebilmen için dua edeceğim küçük adam, öğreneceksin

Asla uyuşturucu satmadım, altın zincirlilerden
İstedim de bir yandan, çok sağlamlar (Evet)
Sahip değildim (Evet) çünkü ceplerimin (Uh)
Dikişleri yoktu, çok fakirdim
Kalan son paramda, bu son şansımdı
Hızlıca hareket etsen iyi olur, tembel bir Pokemon olmamalısın (Hayır)
Uzun otların arasından hızlıca kaç git
Oh hayır, pantolonların çit direğine takıldı
Jackboys'lar tarafından takip ediliyorsun, polisler gelmek üzere
Tüysüz bir silindir gibi geç saat olana kadar bekliyorlar
Parmak uçlarına basarak pencerenden içeri girecekler
Nintendo'nu al ve kaykay kaymaya başla
Domaltılıp tecavüze uğramış gibi hissedeceksin
Evlat, asla halat zincirini eline alamayacaksın
Eşyalarını çaldırt, dudaklarını şişir
Yaşlandıkça iyice acımasızlaştım
Nefretim beni soğutuyor, ve omzuma yük almaya başlıyorum
Kabalaşmaya başlıyorum, posta kodum hayatımın en dip noktası
Ama bugüne kadar üstüne okuduğum her beat'i parçaladım
Kaçtığım bok çukurundan sonra patlamaya başladım, bombaladım, Doğu yakası şizofrene bağladı
Adımı ""B-Side"" sandım çünkü teypimi ters çevirdiler
Hepsini öyle bir büktüm ki şekil şemalleri kalmadı
Oh lanet olsun bro, dur bir dakika, bekle
Az önce pelerinimi taktım (Superman)
Ve izin vermeyeceğim, liriklerimi yazdığım kağıtlara kağıt öğütüyormuş gibi davrandım
Dre onları nasıl parçaladığımı anlatır size
Yani Doktor'un yanındaki adamdan bahsetmek istediğinizde, öğütücüyü kastetmiş olursun
Polisler kafamın içine barikat koymak istiyor
Her şehirde başıma konmuş bir ödül var
Checkers'ta bir kadınla dans ediyorum
Arabasına benzini koyarken ""Fuck Da Police"" eşliğinde kopuyoruz
Bu olay aynı Romper Room gibi
Neden bu çocuklardan kendimi sorumlu hissediyorum ki?
Hepsinin babasıyım
Sizin için Tanrı'yım, üstünde yürüdüğüm suya tapsanız iyi edersiniz
Yoksa hepiniz Waterloo ile tanışacaksınız
Mikrofona öldürücü bir silah gibi bakıyorum
Ekstra şarjör çıkartıyorum, tetiği çekiyorum ve ateş ediyorum
Seni kayıp düşerken yakalamama izin verme
Ortalığın amına koyacağım ve senden de bir pay alacağım
Sızdıran bir musluğun yaptığını yapacağım
Ama sana üstünlük kurmaktan bahsettiğimde damladan bahsetmiyorum
Autotune'la şarkı söyleyen hepinizi sikeyim
Ben çok havaiyim ve katlanması zor bir insanım
Evet olaylar sandalyeye bile anca oturabildiğim anlara doğru gidiyor
Rap için götümü yırttım ve buna yemin ederim
Ritim bile tutturamayan birine diss atmaya değmez
Onlar yazdığı kelimelerin nerede olduğunu bile çözemiyorlar
Keşke davula bi' vursalardı, bateriye bi' kez olsun dokunsalardı
Dua et, yarını göreceksin küçük adam, öğreneceksin
Tüm bu güzel kaltaklar seni yakıp kül edip edecek
Elinde kalan son şeyi satma, kazanmaya devam etsen iyi edersin
Ama yarını görebilmen için dua edeceğim küçük adam, öğreneceksin
Dua et, yarını göreceksin küçük adam, öğreneceksin

Muzaffer olacağım çünkü mirasıma (bacağıma) baktığımda
Bir kaç köpek ona yapışmaya çalışıyor
Triumph The Puppet'a benziyorlar bende dedim ki ''Siktir et''
Yaşanan katliamı kaz ta ki çok yükselene kadar gökyüzüne ulaşana kadar
Hepsinin sıra olup saldırmasına izin ver

Onlara Toy Soldiers diye hitap edin (evet)
Çünkü hepsini arkalarından vuracağım
Şimdi gökyüzü simsiyah
Ama geri dönmeyeceğim,söyleyeceğimi söyledim
Uyanmış olan kendime uyumaya gitmeyi söyledim
Ama yinede hala beni provoke ediyorlar
Beni ruhsal olarak tamamen çökmüş halde görmek istiyorlar
Ama nasıl uyanık olmayabilirim ki?

Çocukken, beni aşağıladılar
Sayılamayacak kadar dışlandım
Durmadan bunu kendime hatırlatmalıyım hem şimdi hem o zaman (Evet)
Rotam böyleydi durmadan kendimi geliştirdim
Bir çukurda, kendime burdan nasıl çıkacağımı öğrettim
Ve yeteneklerimle bunu dengeledim
Çünkü hayat bir bozuk para (Hayat bir bozuk para)
Çünkü sadece yüzde biri
Hayatın vurduğu kişilerin hayatta kalan oranı
Bir asker kaçağıydım (AWOL -a wall) sırtımı buna vermiştim
Bana mücadeleden bahsetme orospu, en derinini ben yaşadım
İlk kez arkamdan bıçakladıklarında 5 ya da 6 yaşındaydım
Malcolm, Isaac, ve Boogie beni ekip üç tekerlekli bisikletimi çaldılar
Ve buna beyaz ırkçılığı der miydim bilmiyorum evet
Ama pigmentlere göre yargılanmanın nasıl bir şey olduğunu biliyorum
Ama iki taraftanda anlayamadım bunu
Ama yemin ederim ki onları geri getirirdim
İntikam almak için ruhumu satmaya bile razıydım (Ne?)
Bir düzen hakkında düşündüm beni fazlasıyla düşündürdü
Kendime güvenirsem,kesinlikle bunu başarırım
İşte bu yüzden durmadan mürekkep ile konuşuyorum
Ve ben son nefesimi verene kadar, yemin ederim ki onları boğup döveceğim
Tanrım, hangi şeytan kalpli onlara gider bende gideceğim
Sanki Aden bahçesindeyim derin son`a yaklaşmak üzereyim
Kötü olan beni çağıryor, şimdiden onla kaynaşıyorum ve

Nereye gidiyorsun?

Peki, Macklemore odasını temiz ve güzel tutarken

Beni haftada iki kere dövüyorlardı (Ne?)
Bir ısırık yemek için
Kanepe yastıklarını altüst ediyordum
Ben ve Denaun birkaç onsent bulabilseydik
İkimize kişi başına 25 kuruşa bir paket cips verirdi
Eski zamanlara dönmek için ters takla atardık
Sanırım o zamanlar hiçbir boka sahip değiliz denilebilirdi
Bu durumu annemin boktan ibaret olduğu ile çarp
Babam bir çuval boktan ibaretti öldü ama sikimde değil
Evet, hangi durum hiçbirzaman sahip olduğum sevgili babama geri götürür
O 1 yaşından 47 yaşına kadar uyuzun tekiydi
Tek istediğim söyleyeceklerimin kulağına küpe olması
Tıpkı kulak mememim bir küpe için bir iğneyle delinmesi gibi
Üzülmelimiyim? sen ölmeden önce benim için ölüydün zaten
Ben mi? bir damla gözyaşım akmadı
Cenazen için süslü bir duvar mı yapmam gerekirdi?
Tabutuna kahraman bayrağı mı örtmeliydim?
Hangi sikimdeydin?
De`Angelo beni Rio Granede`de kötü bir şekilde yaralarken
Asla torunlarınla tanışmadın, siktiğimin korkağı
Tek cesaretli olduğun konu şişman midendi
Seni cennete giderken görmedim
O yüzden cehennemi kontrol etmeye geliyorum
Ki bende seni pataklayabileyim
Yüzüne asla senden nefret ediyorum diyemeyeceğim için bu Durumdan nefret ediyorum
Gideceğim yerden geri dönüş yok
Gökyüzü karanlık,ruhum siyah,elimde kürek
Bıçakla kazıyorum,metalin üstüne adım atıyorum
Kan davamı ödeyeceğim,şeytana söyleyin

Cenneti Terk Ediyorum (Biliyorsun ki, cesedini çıkarana kadar kazmalıyım)

Cenneti Terk ediyorum (Seni sikeyim, orospu)
Cenneti Terk ediyorum (Biliyor musun? hayatımda olsaydın)
Melekler beni bulamayacak (Yaşadığım şeylerin yarısını yaşamayacaktım bu yüzden seni suçluyorum)
Nereye Gidiyorsun? (Ya da sana teşekkürler demeliyim)
(Çünkü sen olsaydın ben kendim olmazdım haha)

Bu yüzden en iyisi koş (Evet)
En iyisi, en iyisi koş (Neyse bırakıp gideceğim. Huzur içinde yat)

И я заработала миллион без контракта с мейджор-лейблом (Я сделала это)
Да, её жопа фальшивая, но она делает реальное дерьмо (Она делает, ах)
Деньги - не главное, далеко не главное
Базарю на языке бедных пацанов (Хах)
И нет, я не фейк, всегда говорю правду (Migo)
Чувак, пока я под кайфом, мои шлюшки сидят и не высовываются (Ууу)
Я просто хочу бабок, и я сейчас не про баб (Ууу)
Поступай правильно и разваливай всё вокруг, режим Дрейка (Хэлло)
Никак не могу наесться, отберу у тебя тарелку с едой (Хэлло)
Презираю тебя и твою жизнь, тусуюсь с парнями в банде (Гррр)
Можешь хоть под землю провалиться, сука, всё равно достану (Хах)
Я сладкая, как торт (Ха), храбрая, как лев, у
Как дела Маршал? Я марсианин, режим Уэйна (Фэктс)
Вся в брюликах, большая капля на шее, дождь из брюликов (Кап, кап, кап)
Восемь ниггеров, восемь парней, они заберут восемь душ (Бррр)
Полные карманы песо, я при деньгах, чё как? (При деньгах)
Покоряю новые вершины (Эй)
Когда боль уходит от нас (Хах)
Куда она попадает? (Куда?)
Конец косяка, вот здесь надо поджигать (Здесь)
В небеса, вот куда улетает мой мозг после затяжки (Воу)
Я всё в той же банде, так же торчу, ношу те же шмотки (Воу)
Мой ствол такой же длинный, как нос у Пиноккио
Я и мои ниггеры должны есть, мы тут все за одного (Что?)
Не суйся к нам, трупы в моём переулке, сука, теперь он перекрыт
Конец игры, разнесу вас, шлюшек, как Танос
Все вы, жалкие педики, лишь грязь под моими ногтями (Йеа)
Дай мне вантуз (Вантуз), Маршалл и М.А сейчас вытащат всё дерьмо наружу
Зови нас Тирет-турбо, даже Дре знает, как мы работаем (Дре знает)
Взрываю бит, как взорвал бы Detox
Чтобы остановить меня, тебе понадобятся минимум трое полицейских, но даже с наручниками на руках я не замолчу
Пожалуйста, чувак, не прекращай нести хуйню, я питаюсь ею
Я - полная противоположность этих отсталых рэперов, которые не могут даже выдать рифму, сейчас устрою резню
Каждая моя мысль будет настолько ядовитой, что вы поперхнётесь, суки
Заткну ваши пищеводы, перекрою доступ к кислороду
И надеру ваши задницы с одной ручкой в руках
Присматривай получше за Слимом, и, когда я снова буду в топе, тебе лучше хлопать в ладоши
Не то я доберусь до тебя и размажу, меня не остановить
Меня спрашивали, закончилась ли война с MGK? Конечно
Я очистил его от смертных грехов, я Бог, а Господь прощает даже сатанистов
Я двигаюсь дальше, чего ещё ждать от парня с рогами, как у Люцифера
Все мои ученики из школы Notorious, Puba, Cube, а The Poor Righteous Teachers обучали их
Показали им все «Чертежи» и «Формулы»
Но чем больше я смотрю на них, тем больше я злюсь
Тем сильнее у меня закатываются глаза
И я выпускаю очередной релиз и кричу: ""Сбросить бомбы!"" на рэп-игру
Словно я в толпе на концерте Арианы Гранде

Вот вам Саддам Хусейн, Рухолла Хомейни
А где же Усама? Я был сильно загружен в последнее время
Они видят, как я веду себя, хотят, чтобы я ушёл из игры
Хотят прикончить меня (Пошёл ты) в моём же доме, я не позволю
Чёрт, я не понимаю, почему они меня ненавидят (Хах?)
Я такой же клоун, как Джон Уэйн Гейси (Что?)
Они называют меня сумасшедшим Канье (Йеа)
APESHIT, Бейонсе, Джей-Зи (Ву-у)
И я вернулся с Дре, детка (Йеа)
Он снова за пультом
И мы устроим с ним разнос, как когда-то устроили Снуп, Кей-Дот и Шейди
Шейди стал твоей тенью, проник в тебя, прямо в разум, дай-ка узнаю, почему ты расстроен
Потому что я познакомился с твоей сучкой в инете, и теперь она насасывает мне
Эта малышка обхватила губами стояк и принялась за работу
Словно она очищает от пыли старый картридж Нинтендо
Вот же были времена, но клянусь, я не вернусь к этому дерьму, нет
Я не курю, если и сворачиваю бумагу, то только деньги в рулетик
Я реальный на один, ноль, запятая, ноль, ноль, ноль процентов
Реально, реально, реально, убью, убью, убью, порву, порву, порву
Никелированный, двадцать второй, второй, второй
Сука, заткнись нахуй, пока я тебя тоже не пристрелил
Не буду заниматься какой-то хуйнёй, чтобы получить пару просмотров на Youtube
Забегаю в церковь, пью, пью, пью
Это именно то, что я де-ла-ю
Даже слепой заметит, что
Мы с тобой разные, ты и я
И кто-то должен был объяснить тебе, что
Идти против меня - это просто безумие, ты умрёшь (Йеа)
Меня же называли Камикадзе, ты это забыл? Заберу тебя с собой, йеа
Я знаю магию, и вот мой последний трюк
Я собираюсь сказать ""абракадабра"" и вытащить Кролика из своей шляпы
Я вот-вот сойду с ума и, держу пари, что ты не знаешь, как на это реагировать
Могу сказать, что выражение отвращения точно появится на твоём лице
Как только я начну, блять, разъёбывать трек за треком
А ты сдашь назад, испугаешься, убежишь
Как сауды, когда рухнули башни
Вот вам Саддам Хусейн, Рухолла Хомейни
А где же Усама? Я был сильно загружен в последнее время
Они видят, как я веду себя, хотят, чтобы я ушёл из игры

Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's got a past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

We cop new timepieces when these fools deny Jesus
Hate is a sin, dog, be real, I got my hand on the pump
You on Twitter in your feels, throwin' subs, arguin’ with chicks
I pray for these niggas, same hands that I hustle with
Passin' the offering plates, I'm the preacher in foreign whips
Sermons and politics, miracles come with each and every flip
That dinero from zero, so heaven-sent
Immaculate, blessings from Mary, I reminisce
On days we was broke, all we had was some common sense
Last night, I had a nightmare I was at the stove
I woke up in Paris cookin’ up for Hov
That's why I thank the Lord for givin' me this life
And even when I'm gone the music keepin' us alive
Yeah, it's called forever-ever
Ever-ever, ever-ever, family ties

Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh
I'm so grateful, all I need is love

Eight balls, some poppy, went and dunked it in the Pyrex
Mischievous thoughts ’fore seein’ the sauce
Told Montana in the G, chicky poo in the Porsche, uh
The Frank Sinatra of the Spanish mobsters
We the Jimmy's Cafe, ain’t no need for operas
Had the fiends scream, ""Hallelujah,"" fuck the prosecutor
Gave my nigga fifty years and he was not the shooter
When they see us, solitar' confinement
Dig deep in your mind, no pressure, no diamonds
So we live a life, drop a hundred at the ferry, yeah
My chick's from San Fran', but stay out my bae area
You salute the cross, or you rebuke the cross
Either way you meet the Lord when you get moved across
Death knockin’ at your door got you squeezin' handle
And you ain't seen God 'til you starin' down a barrel
And I've been good, oh
All I need is love
To the Lord above

I'm sittin' here reminiscin'
Think I just got a light bulb
Somethin' I'd like to mention, this is just on a side note
Word to the Terror Squad, Joe, this is all puns aside though
I know me and Mariah didn't end on a high note
But that other dude's whipped, that pussy got him neutered
Tried to tell him this chick's a nutjob 'fore he got his jewels clipped
Almost got my caboose kicked
Fool, quit, you not gon' do shit
I let her chop my balls off too 'fore I lost to you, Nick
I should quit watchin' news clips, yeah
My balls are too big, I should be talkin' pool 'cause I got scratch
So my pockets full when I'm takin' shots at you
Fuck it, lemme chalk the cue stick
I'm over the top, like Cool Whip
And I promise you the day I fall off or lose it
I will stop and cut off the music
Opportunist, wanna kill shit every chance that I got to do this
Stackin' my guap, savage, I'm not to fool with
Like a handgun, you could say I'm like a gat when it's cocked
I keep it a (Buck, buck), your ass'll get shot

You'd act like you strapped when you're not
Only cap that you pop is the top on the can of your pop
You the man 'til I pop your top

Rest in peace to Afeni and her son Pac
You sent me that plaque with his rhyme sheet, I haven't forgot (Nah)
Blow 30 million in a month, call it Brewster's Millions
Just hope I don't lose the feelin', from soldier to civilian
Got everything I need
But I don't even see myself in the future chillin'
Only thing I don't have in the booth's a ceiling
Just call me The Roofless Villain
They tellin' me sky's the limit, so I got my head in the clouds
Unicorn in human form, saw a gift horse
Looked him dead in the mouth
And Lord, good lookin' out
For sendin' me Edna and Charles
Whenever Mom kicked me out of the house
They were the bomb, then you sent me LL
All the times that I hated myself, since eleven or twelve
Only way that I knew how to better myself
Is when I'm bet against by everyone else
So, Joe hit the head on the nail
You ain't seen God 'til you starin' down a barrel
I was gun-shy, but now like a snail
The slug's comin' out of its shell
Oh, there's no hate in this world
That can make me give up
That can keep me stuck

I love my country up loud
I'm talking way up loud

I like pop, and rock, and rap, I like Skynyrd
And going out downtown when I'm with her
Like driving too fast down a four-lane road
But damn sure nowhere close to the way that

I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country, I love my country up loud (Yeah, baby, ooh)
I love my country up loud, yeah, way up loud

The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot
A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the leadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Frank-sinatra-jingle-bells-lyrics,2019-01-05

Ever since I got successful, they envy
Tryna shake the devil, on promethazine
Tryna show you love but you don't feel me
Gave up on me so you turned your back
I can see the demons 'cause a nigga been blessed
I can tell you worried, but a nigga been in debt
I can't get caught up inside the matter
I should've did better, but it's chatter
I ran up my money off the gravel
Love is just a word, it don't matter to me
I got so rich, nothing matters to me
I'm livin' my second life, it's so amazin'
I done been hit with a bullet, and one grazed me
I done been considered a failure, it don't faze me

Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

Goin' insane, feel you pickin' up and movin' things inside my brain
I know I don't have to argue about everything
But we don't have the same soul
Would've sold yours too and got a bigger bankroll
You tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
Repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
Picked up the drugs so I let my brain go
Woulda fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh

Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions

When I poured it, I gave her a dose, said she was already hooked
If you always there for me, that's a rеally good look

Came up off a brick
Bought a Richard Mille, my new watch don't tick
Drippin' in Louis V, made a movie, and Prada another film
It's the Don Dada, I stand this Lamborghini on one wheel
Twelve o'clock, and I got my gun clocked, and I'm on one pill

Gettin' my lettuce, I'm gettin' my paper, I'm gettin' my trees (Woo, woo)
One thousand percent, keep it one thousand with me (Woo, woo, yeah)
Started with my squad, so I can't chill
Money over bitches, gotta play the field

Sipping on codeine got my screws loose
Making all this money got my screws loose (Yeah)
Ridin' Lamborgini made her pussy juicy
Grippin' on the wheel, playin' in her pussy
Diamonds on my neck been going crazy
I think I need to see a psychiatrist (Ooh)
Living in the streets and the gutter raised me
I know how to sell narcotics (Yeah)

When they let us off of lock', man, we gon' make that shit pop
Been humpin' wifey for so long, she got a limp when she walk
Got seven drops in four spots, I get to pick where I live
In the back they playin' twinsies like a Hugh Hefner zoo
On my teeth, these diamonds twinkle, in her legs a jacuzzi
I be tweakin' every day, I got some screws missin'
I keep an Air Max pump on me, no, not my 270s (Yeah)
And they know just where I be, it's like I'm 713 (Yeah)
Havin' money on this side is not the conversation (Yeah, yeah)

Stuffed on my last hit, I was in the middle seat

""Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history""
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee

480,2114,Halsey,Halsey,Nightmare,11,15,"Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""

But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware

Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road

If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner, but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

Oh

If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'

Sip from the bottle for shit that we bottlin' in
Goin' live, but we not on the 'Gram
This the land of supply and demand
Where my young niggas choppin' up grams
And them choppers won't pry from they hands
Packin' lead like they got a exam
If it's beef, my niggas look just like homewreckers
They got they eye on your mans
I pray to God that it jam
Too many done died in these parts
So we gotta be smart if we tryna see August
Some niggas won't make it past summer regardless
I'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits
These niggas be lookin' at me like I got it
Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke
As that nigga who just graduated from college
Scrapin' up change that got left in my pockets
I'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar
Ridin' the train, way too shy to go holler
Just watched her get off at her stop, I'm a coward
Fuck it, though, you got a way bigger target
I'ma do it so big, they won't know what to call it
Sound like a whole Lambo' truck in my stomach
Bitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving
Gotta move mama from out them apartments
Gotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten
Gotta hit hoes you hang up in your locker
Gotta get rich, 'cause my granny picked cotton
Gotta make hits, 'cause if not, then I'm floppin'
Gotta stay me in the process
Niggas dissed me, it was nonsense
I sat 'em down like his father
My nigga asked, ""Why you bother?
We should've caught him and mobbed him""
I said, ""We gotta move smarter""
Don't wan' be the reason for one more sad song
I tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long
I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit, but they made they attempts
May have a good year like that name on the blimp
But you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price
Young Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God
Half the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?
But that's treacherous, that shows less of us
I need y'all to see every part of me
Every scar and every artery
Every story that I can recall, then I can fall
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie

I got it up off the floor, I'm stronger than ever before
I'm stronger than ever before just like I planned to be
They wanna see me fold, it ain't no thang to me
Thoughts when I was broke, if only I could be
Pockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me
At night, I hit my knees, I prayed for better days
Then found a better me, I got my head on straight

Up, up, and away, just ridin' my wave, I ain't never gon' say nothin'
Nigga throw a shot my way, I just jot down names, ain't never gon' say nothin'
Know you be stressin', hate only block your blessin', I'm never gon' say nothin'
Quit all that flexin', niggas live check to check, I'm never gon' say nothin'

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

505,7758,J. Cole,J. Cole,Snow On Tha Bluff,2,54,"Niggas be thinkin' I'm deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some ""Fuck a retweet,"" most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, ""Wait""
He was like, ""Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real""
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today

Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin' to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive103EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/J-cole-snow-on-tha-bluff-lyrics,2020-06-27

You should let me break your spine just a little
Got your shawty on my pistol, made her empty out the clip
I swear I'm too official, I could never stress a bitch
I done lost a couple soldiers, every day I reminisce
And I could've took his bitch, but her pussy smelled like fish
Me and all my niggas on the ship like marijuana
Only time a nigga hit my phone is when there's drama
Niggas feel a type of way 'cause I do what I wanna
While you was scared of sharks, I was posted with piranhas
I heard that you freaky, maybe you should teach me
I'm afraid to tell you how these other bitches treat me
Don't gotta worry, I'ma pull up when you need me
How my bitch bad is what I wonder like I'm Stevie

I swear to God you better never try to leave me
I want you to myself, I swear to God I'm greedy
I gotta move a type of way, no, it ain't easy
'Cause at the light is where these niggas tryna leave me
I gotta be cautious, these niggas like to talk shit
I remember when I pulled up on your shorty and she lost it
I was in the trenches, I was moving with them bosses
You was on the benches, you was dwelling over losses

How to let you go and let communication die out


I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't

You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?

If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?

It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen

The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, ""My God, I wanna be in that scene""
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen (Seen)
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)

Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, ""Shut up,"" like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, ""Throw it on""
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, ""Hell nah, boy"" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)

Sul futon, le sto dando quel cazzo
Quando questa merda è pronta, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, come Gilbert Arenas, sparo il colpo
Sono ancora con i demoni, ooh, I keep it thorough
Ho cinque tipe a New York
Questo significa una in ogni quartiere
Sono nel pocket come Burrow

Mi trattano come Robert De Niro
La ho portata Taco Bell, le ho comprato un churro
La ho portata a casa, le ho dato un cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year old
Zeri su zeri su zeri (Zeri)
Quello è cosa il bilancio del mio conto bancario dice (Woo)
Ho a check dalla compagnia di scarpe
Ora faccio qualsiasi cosa che dice New Balance
Le ho comprato un biglietto aereo, fuori di stato
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Ho detto, ""Sono in città oggi""
Lei ha detto che she comin' over and she down to stay

She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree

I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler in case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch

Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back

I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that ""ya'll come back"" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say

It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud

Savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but you're savage, love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air

Screenplay by
Kevin Smith

OVER BLACK WE SEE:
CHYRON
A long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far
away--
EXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY
We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from
sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK --
a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A
white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap
comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an
oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe,
and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in
the Mother's hands.
MOTHER
Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks
up the free cheese, 'kay?
She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly,
then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her
baseball cap and places it on the baby.
MOTHER
This'll keep the sun out of your
eyes. You be good now.
She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall.
With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his
mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks
kind of familiar.
Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS
concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair
enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip.
She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets
her Baby down beside him.
MOTHER
Don't fucking move, you little shit-
machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.
A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He
takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the
record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.
PASSERBY
Excuse me--who's watching these
babies?
MOTHER
The fat one's watching the little
one.
PASSERBY
Oh, nice parenting.
(walking away)
Leave'em out here like that and see
what happens.
The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.
MOTHER
FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!
PASSERBY
(waving her off)
Ah, keep on truckin'.
MOTHER
(to baby)
D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me
how to fuckin' raise you?
Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking
think he is? What's the worse fuckin'
thing could happen to you sitting
outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!
The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat.
Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing.
The smaller one says--
BABY
Fuck, fuck, fuck...
DISSOLVE TO:
THE PRESENT
JAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record
Rack is now RST VIDEO.
Jay is mid-chant.
JAY
(as a chant)
--fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother
fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother-
fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck,
noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed,
smoking weed, doing coke, drinking
beers!  Drinking beers, beers, beers,
rolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who
smokes the blunts? We smoke the
blunts!
A pair of TEENS approach them.
TEEN 1
Lemme get a nickel bag.
JAY
Fifteen bucks, little man. Put that
shit in my hand. If the money does
not show, then you owe-me-owe-me-
owe.
(changing up to Morris
Day)
My Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh!
I think I want to know ya', know ya'--
TEEN 1
(digging in pockets)
What the hell are you singing?
JAY
You don't know ""Jungle Love""? That
shit is the mad notes. Written by
God Herself and handed down to the
world's greatest band--the
motherfucking Time.
TEEN 2
The guys in that Prince movie?
TEEN 1
Purple Rain.
TEEN 2
Man, that shit was so gay--fucking
eighties style.
Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against
the wall.
JAY
Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind
word about The Time! Me and Silent
Bob modeled our whole fucking lives
after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a
smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and
Tubby here's my black manservant!
Just then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door
behind him.
RANDAL
What'd I tell you two about dealing
in front of the store? Drop the kid
and peddle your wares someplace else,
burn-boy.
(walking away)
And for the record, The Time sucked
ass.
He exits. Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go. After
a beat--
JAY
Yo-youse guys wanna hear something
fucked up about him and the Quick
Stop guy?
INT. QUICK STOP-DAY
Randal joins Dante behind the counter. Dante rings up a
customer, a half-eaten submarine sandwich sitting on the
counter. Randal grabs it, takes a bite, and starts reading a
newspaper.
RANDAL
Hey, can't we do something about
those two stoners hanging around
outside all the time?
DANTE
Why? What'd they do now?
RANDAL
I'm trying to watch Clash of the
Titans, and all I can hear is the
two them screaming about Morris Day
at the top of their lungs.
DANTE
I thought the fat one didn't really
talk much.
RANDAL
What, am I producing an A&E Biography
about 'em? I'm just saying they
shouldn't be loitering around the
stores like they do.
DANTE
Neither should you, but we let you
stay.
RANDAL
See, man--if you were funnier than
that, ABC never would've canceled
us.
DANTE
What?
RANDAL
Nothing.
Enter Teen 1 and Teen 2, chuckling.
TEEN 1
Two packs of Wraps.
(beat)
Yo--how was the service?
RANDAL
What service?
TEEN 2
The one at the Unitarian church where
you two got married to each other
last week.
RANDAL
What the hell are you talking about?
TEEN 1
Jay said you had a Star-Wars--themed
wedding and you guys tied the knot
dressed like storm troopers.
TEEN 2
Yeah. And he said you're the bitch
and you're the butch. Oh, sorry--the
Leia and the Luke.
DANTE
I'm the bitch?!
RANDAL
Well if we were gay, that's how I'd
see it.
DANTE
Would you shut up?!
TEEN 1
(to TEEN 2)
Holy shit, dude. The honeymoon's
over.
DANTE
We're not married to each other.
TEEN 1
Well, sure. Not in the eyes of the
state or any real church, Skywalker.
RANDAL
(heading for the phone)
That does it. I'm gonna do something
about those two. I shoulda done a
long time ago
TEEN 2
In a galaxy far, far away!
TEEN 1
(exiting)
May the Foreskin be with you. Hand
Jabba the Hutt.
RANDAL
(into phone)
Yeah, I want to report a couple of
drug dealers out in front of the
Quick Stop.
EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY
Jay and Silent Bob are thrown against the wall outside by a
COP, who frisks them.
JAY
What the Fuck, Serpico? What'd we
do?
COP
We got a report that two guys were
hanging around outside the stores,
selling pot?
JAY
We don't smoke pot, yo.
Teen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers.
TEEN 1
Here're the rolling papers you wanted
for your pot. And your change. Thanks.
(getting in Jay's
face)
And The Time sucks ass!
Teen 1 races off. Jay and Bob move to follow, but the Cop
stops them, grabbing the rolling papers out of Jay's hand.
He eyeballs the pair.
COP
No pot, hunh? What do you need this
for?
JAY
What?  I got a wiping problem. I
stick these little pieces of paper
over my brown-eye, and bam--no shit
stains in my undies.
(unbuttoning pants)
You don't believe me? Lemme show
you.
Jay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back
over his shoulder.
JAY
Just spread my cheeks a little and
you can see the fucking stink nuggets--
COP
Pull up your pants up sir, Now!
Jay bends down to pull up his pants and FARTS. Silent Bob
cracks up. The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the
car.
COP
Let's take a ride down to the station.
JAY
What? It's suddenly a crime to fart,
motherfucker?!
EXT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--DAY
An ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red
Bank.
BRODIE (O.S.)
No fucking way!
WE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to--
INT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--LATER
BRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a
Dixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he
puts new books in the racks.
BRODIE
Dante and Randal slapped you with a
restraining order?!
JAY
Judge said if we go within a hundred
feet of the stores, we get thrown
into County.
BRODIE
So you gonna abide by the court's
ruling or you gonna go Bandit--
Reynolds style?
JAY
Fuck yeah! You know what they make
you do in county? Toss the fucking
salad! I don't like this fuck's
asshole; I'm gonna do it for some
stranger?
BRODIE
I guess if you really wanted to hang
out in from of a convenience store,
you could just buy your own now--
what with all that money you guys
made.
JAY
Hell yeah, bitch.
(beat)
Wait a second--what money?
BRODIE
The money from the movie, dumb-ass.
JAY
What the fuck are you babbling about?
BRODIE
(pulling a bagged-and-
boarded issue down
from the wall)
The Bluntman and Chronic movie.
(dawns on him)
Oh my God--don't tell me you have no
idea there's a movie being made of
the comic you two were the basis
for.
JAY
What?! Since when?
BRODIE
Goddamit, man--
(taps his wrist)
Here's the pulse, alright. And here's
your finger--
(shoves his hand down
the back of his pants)
--far from the pulse, jammed straight
up your ass.
(extracts hand and
extends it to Jay)
Say--would you like a chocolate
covered pretzel?
Brodie leads them back to the counter.
BRODIE
You see, kids, if you read Wizard,
you'd know it's the top story this
month.  Check it out.
Brodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to
the headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get
Big Screen Treatment!  There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL
AND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and
Chronic.
JAY
When the fuck did this happen?!
BRODIE
Well, after X-Men hit at the box
office, all the studios started buying
up every comic property they could
get their hands on. Miramax optioned
Bluntman and Chronic.
JAY
Miramax? I thought they only made
classy flicks like The Piano and The
Crying Game?
BRODIE
Yeah, well once they made She's All
That, everything went to hell. So
you're saying you haven't gotten a
cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil
and Banky Edwards used to pay you
likeness rights for the comic book?
JAY
We haven't seen a fucking dime for
no movie!
BRODIE
Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think
Holden and Banky owe you some of the
proverbial phat cash. I mean they're
making a movie based on characters
that are based on you and Quiet
Robert.
JAY
It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a
pair of stupid-ass superheroes that
run around saying ""Snitchy-Nitchies""
or something.
BRODIE
I believe it ""Snootchie Boochies.""
Regardless--you're getting screwed.
If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden
McNeil and ask him for my movie check.
JAY
Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid.
BRODIE
And on that note, we cue the music.
Jay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with
his own beat.
EXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY
Jay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building
and knock.
INT. POTZER'S INC--DAY
Holden McNeil, opens the door and smiles.
HOLDEN
Well! I have been waiting years to
do this.
(smiles)
Look at these morose motherfuckers
right here. Smells like someone shit
in their cereal. Bunngg!
Jay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following
them.
JAY
What the fuck took you so long
answering your damn door? You trying
to talk another girlfriend of yours
into some of that gay-ass three-way
action with your buddy?
HOLDEN
No, I was just showering your mother's
stink off me after I gave her a quick
jump and sent her home. But now that
you mention it--
(to Bob)
Thanks, you know. You could've made
the moral of that story you told me
a bit more clear.
Silent Bob shrugs.
HOLDEN
So what brings you two dirt merchants
to my neck of the woods?
JAY
Oh, I'll tell you what our necks are
doing in your woods--
Silent Bob holds up the Wizard article.
JAY
Where's our motherfucking movie check?
HOLDEN
You heard about that too, Hunh? Well,
I've got nothing to do with it. That's
Banky's deal. He owns the property
now. I signed my half of the Bluntman
and Chronic right over to him years
ago.
JAY
Why the fuck would you do a thing
like that?
HOLDEN
Because I'm almost thirty, for God's
sake--why on earth would I want to
keep writing about characters whose
central preoccupations are weed and
dick and fart jokes? You gotta grow,
man. Don't you ever want more for
yourself?
(off Silent Bob)
I know this poor, hapless sonovabitch
does. I look in his doe eyes and I
see a man crying out, ""When, Lord?
When the fuck can your servant ditch
this foul-mouthed little chucklehead
to whom I am a constant victim of
his folly, and who bombards me and
those around us with grade-A
foolishness that prevents me from
even getting to kiss a girl? Fuck!
When?!
Silent Bob nod like he's finally understood. Jay looks at
him, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth.
JAY
I'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're
the dumb-ass who gave away his comic,
and now you ain't got no fat movie
check neither.
HOLDEN
When you're right, you're right. I
wish I'd broken off a little piece
for myself. Because if the buzz is
any indication, the movie's gonna
make some huge bank.
JAY
What buzz?
HOLDEN
The Internet buzz.
JAY
What the fuck is the Internet?
INT. OFFICE OF POTZER'S INC--LATER
Holden's at a computer terminal. Jay and Silent bob look
over his shoulder.
HOLDEN
The Internet is a communication device
that allows people the world over to
bitch about movies and share
pornography with one another.
(off monitor)
Here's what we're looking for: ""Movie
PoopShoot.com""
JAY
(to Bob)
""PoopChute."" Yeaaahhh.
HOLDEN
This is a site full of militant movie
buffs: sad bastards who live in their
parents' basements, downloading
scripts and trading what they believe
to be inside info about movies and
actors they despise yet can't stop
discussing. This is where you go if
you wanna hear frustrated would-be
filmmakers mouth off with their two-
bit, arm-chair-director's opinions
on how they all could've made a better
Episode One.
On the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up.
Holden begins navigating the site.
HOLDEN
Here. This is about the Bluntman
movie.
(reading)
""Inside sources tell me Miramax is
starting production this Friday on
their adaptation of underground comic
fave Bluntman and Chronic.""
JAY
Friday?! Shit. Does it say who's
playing us in the movie?
HOLDEN
No, but if it's Miramax, I'm sure
it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.
They put'em in a bunch of movies.
JAY
Who?
HOLDEN
You know--the guys from Good Will
Hunting.
JAY
You mean the fucking movie with Mork
from Ork in it?
HOLDEN
Yeah, I'm not too big a fan either.
Though Affleck was the bomb in
Phantoms.
JAY
Word, bitch. Phantoms like a
motherfucker.
Holden and Jay slap hands. Holden points at the monitor again.
HOLDEN
Now down here is where you can gauge
the buzz. This is the Shoot Back
area. It's where people who read the
news get to chime in with their two
cents. Here's what a guy who goes by
the chick-magnet Net handle of ""Wampa-
One"" thinks about Bluntman and
Chronic.
(reading)
""Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid
alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only
work in small doses, if at all. They
don't deserve their own movie.""
(to Jay)
He's got a point.
JAY
Fuck him. What's the next one say?

(reading)
""Bluntman and Chronic is the worst
comic I ever read. Jay and Silent
Bob are stupid characters. A couple
of stoners who spout dumb-ass
catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech
and Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay
and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their
stupid asses.""
JAY
Who the fuck said that shit?!
HOLDEN
A guy who calls himself ""Magnolia-
Fan.""  Check out what the guy after
him said: ""Jay and Silent Bob are
terrible, one-note jokes that only
stoners laugh at.  They're fucking
clown shoes. If they were real, I'd
beat the shit out of them for being
so stupid. I can't believe Miramax
would have anything to so with this
shit. I, for one, will be boycotting
this movie. Who's with me?""
(leans back)
And then there are about fifty more
posts from people who agree to join
Spartacus-here's boycott of the flick.
JAY
(grimly)
I'm gonna kill all these fucks--
HOLDEN
Ah, let it go. Number one, they're a
bunch of jealous little dicks who
use the anonymity of the Net to insult
people who're doing what they wish
they were doing, and number two,
they're not really talking about you
guys--they talking about Bluntman
and Chronic.
JAY
But they said Jay and Silent Bob!
They used our real names. It doesn't
matter that there's a comic book
version of us and a real version,
'cause nobody knows we're real in
real life.
HOLDEN
Really.
JAY
Yeah! And all these people who read
that shit think the real Jay and
Silent Bob are a couple of faggots
'cause of that all these dicks are
writing about the comic book Jay and
Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me
and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch,
and she'll be like ""Oooo! I want to
suck youse guys dicks off. What's
your names?""  And I'll be like, ""Jay
and Silent Bob."" And she'll be like,
""Oh--I read on the Internet that
youse guys were little fucking
jerkoffs.""  And then she goes and
sucks two other guys's dicks off
instead! Well fuck that!  We gotta
put a stop to these hateful sonsa-
bitches before they ruin our good
names!
HOLDEN
First off, I don't know how good
your names really are. Secondly,
there's not much you can do about
stopping this bile. The Internet's
given everyone in America a voice,
and everyone in American has chosen
to use that voice to bitch about
movies. As long as there's a Bluntman
and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are
gonna have something negative to say
about it.  Jay steams, thinking.
Then, a light dawns on him.
JAY
But wait a second--if there wasn't a
Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no
one would be saying shit about Jay
and Silent Bob, right?
HOLDEN
They're not saying anything about
you now--they're talking about
fictional characters!
JAY
(oblivious to Holden;
to Bob)
So all we gotta do is stop 'em from
making the movie!
HOLDEN
Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of
thousands of dollars in royalties
you're due in the process. Are you
fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably
not alone in the opinion that this
flick is the worst idea since Greedo
shooting first. I mean, a Jay and
Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to
see that?
Holden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for
a beat. Then--
HOLDEN
But since it is happening, you might
as well just ignore the idiots on
the Internet, go find Banky, and get
your ""motherfucking movie check."" As
you so succinctly put it. That's
what's important here.
JAY
No, Holden McNeil--what's important
here is that there's a bunch of
motherfuckers we don't even know
calling us assholes on the Internet
to a bunch of teenagers and guys who
can't even get laid. Putting a stop
to that is the most important thing
we could ever do.
(off monitor)
When did it say they're making that
movie?
HOLDEN
They start this Friday.
JAY
So if today's Tuesday, that gives us--
(counts)
Eight days.
HOLDEN
It's more like three days.
JAY
Right. Three days to stop that stupid
fucking movie from getting made!
C'mon, Silent Bob--
Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.
JAY
We're going to Hollywood.
They stride off. Holden shakes his head.
HOLDEN
Now that's what I call the Blunt
leading the Blunt.
EXT. BUS STATION--DAY
Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled ""Los
Angeles."" They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After
a beat, they re-emerge.
JAY
Tickets? Since when did they start
charging for the bus?
They head toward the depot.
JAY
Didn't we used to ride that shit to
school every day for free?
EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY
The bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey.
INT. BUS--SAME
Jay makes his way up to the DRIVER.
JAY
We in Hollywood yet?
DRIVER
It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles,
sir. We left twenty minutes ago.
JAY
I didn't ask you about Los Angeles.
I asked you about Hollywood.
DRIVER
Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir.
JAY
Don't change the subject! Are we in
Hollywood yet or not?
DRIVER
Please sit down, sir.
Jay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat.
JAY
Why don't you take your seat Ralph
Kramden--
Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.
JAY
I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't
shit to so on this bus.
Silent Bob mimes jerking off.
JAY
I already did that. Twice.
Silent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across
the aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld
video game. He leans over to him.
JAY
Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.
CHILD
Leave me alone, little kid.
The Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning
to Silent Bob.
JAY
That fuck called me a little kid and
gave me the finger! Go kick his ass!
Silent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, ""He's
ten years old.""
JAY
You're my muscle, ain'tcha?
Silent Bob kind of nods.
JAY
So go open a can of whup-ass on that
little fuck, and get me his game!
Silent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the
aisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and
registers doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on.
Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches
for his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts
punching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his
seat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay
looks at Silent Bob.
JAY
You're one tough motherfucker, you
know that?
EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY
The bus pulls over by the side of the road.
INT. BUS--DAY
The Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the
bus, followed by pissed-off PASSENGERS.
PASSENGER
They been in there going on half an
hour now! Two of them! Doing God
knows what!
The Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.
DRIVER
This bus isn't moving another inch
unless you clear out of there right
now!
No answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.
DRIVER
DO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR!
NOW!!
The door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive
amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the
bus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed
into the bathroom, holding a massive joint.
JAY
Um--I think something's burning back
here.
EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER
As the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left
behind.
JAY
The whole fucking world's against
us, dude. I swear to God.
Silent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.
EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER
Jay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.
JAY
This sucks balls, man. How come we
ain't getting no rides?
VOICE
'Cause you're doing it all wrong.
Jay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.
GUY
You gotta induce the drivers a little.
JAY
Like how?
GUY
Like this.
The GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head
For Ride.
JAY
Yeah, but what happens when you get
in the car, and you don't make with
the head? Don't they kick your ass
to the curb?
GUY
Sure--if you don't make with the
head.
Jay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--
JAY
Eww! You eat the cock?!?
GUY
Yeah. If it'll get me a few hundred
miles across country. I'll take a
shot in the mouth.
JAY
Yeah, but we ain't gay.
GUY
Well, neither am I. But have you
seen the price of bus tickets lately?
Shit--I don't wanna cough up two
hundred bucks just to get to Chicago.
JAY
Well, I don't wanna cough up some
dude's sperm!
GUY
Don't be so suburban--this is the
new millennium. Gay, straight--it's
all the same now. There're no more
lines.
Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot.
JAY
There's one. On this side of it, we
ain't gay.
GUY
All hitchers do this. Why do you
think people pick us up? If you get
a ride, it's expected--I don't care
who the driver is. It's the first
rule in the Book.
JAY
What book?
GUY
The unwritten Book of the Road.
A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy
points to it, as if to say ""See?"" The passenger-side door
opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He
looks out the window at Jay and Bob.
GUY
Follow the rules of the Book, and
you'll get where you're going in no
time.  Excuse me.
Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go
face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers
smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.
Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR
pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window
and leans toward them.
NUN
You two boys need a ride?
INT. CAR--LATER
The NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back
seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun.
NUN
You both don't have to sit back there.
One of you can sit up here with me.
Silent Bob shakes his head ""no"" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs
up front.
NUN
So where are you boys from?
JAY
New Jersey.
NUN
What brings you to Indiana?
JAY
We're going to Hollywood.
NUN
Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways
away.
JAY
Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up.
NUN
Well, do unto others. That's what
the Book says.
JAY
(misinterpreting
completely)
Wait a minute--you follow the Book,
too?
NUN
I live my life by it.
JAY
Really? You?
NUN
Of course. You know how lonely it
gets on the road? Thanks to the Book,
I'm never alone--if you know what I
mean.
JAY
I guess. This guy back there explained
it to us. But I didn't think you'd
be into that.
NUN
Are you kidding? I've dedicated my
life to it. Every hour of every day.
JAY
Shit--you nuns are alright.
NUN
You live by the Book, too?
JAY
You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.
NUN
That's good to hear. But it takes
deed, not words. It's a lot easier
to say you live by the Book than to
actually do it.
(looks at him)
Can you do it?
JAY
You want me to do it right now?
NUN
No time like the present, right?
Jay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head
""no."" Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and
starts to bend down.
JAY
Alright.
(he suddenly stops)
You hear that? She's not a Catholic.
She's a Presbyterian.
Jay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed.
EXT. ROADSIDE--DAY
The Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets
kicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent
Bob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his
mouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.
JAY
Dude--she had seventies bush.
EXT. HIGHWAY--NIGHT
Jay and Bob continue hitching.
JAY
I can't believe this shit. Five hours
and not a single ride. Every day,
millions of people hitch to Hollywood
and stop studios from making movies
about 'em. But when you and me try
it, it's like we're trapped in a
fucking cartoon!
A familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the
raid, The horn beeps.  Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug,
and race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.
INT. VAN--NIGHT
Jay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at--
A clean-cut GUY, a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed
Beauty, a stoner DUDE, and a GREAT DANE.
Jay looks at Silent Bob.
JAY
Zoinks, yo
GUY
And now we can finally solve the
mystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls!
Pull off their masks and let's see
who they really are!
BOOKISH
I don't think they are masks.
BEAUTY
I don't think they're Hitchhiking
Girls either.
BOOKISH
Ghouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls.
(to herself)
Though I wish they were hitchhiking
girls. Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking
girls--
GUY
Let's kick them out. We've got a
mystery to solve.
DUDE
The only mystery here is why we take
our cues from a dick in a neckerchief!
GUY
Keep it up, Beatnik! I'll feed you
to the fucking dog!
BEAUTY
(covering her ears;
shrieking)
I CAN'T TAKE ALL THIS FIGHTING!
JAY
YO!
The Gang look to Jay and Bob.
JAY
Youse guys need to turn those frowns
upside down! And we got just the
thing for that.
(pulls out a bag of
joints)
We call them Doobie Snax.
INT. VAN--WEED VISION
As Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky
(with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze,
we see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling
about their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken
off to reveal a man inside a costume.
Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint
and look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total
debauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy
cackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish
and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other.
The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--
GREAT DANE
Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob
The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking
way out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide-
eyed.
JAY
Look at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's
got a stoner-boner!!!
Jay and Bob smile and pass out.
We cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to
Weed-Vision. They stare at the O.C. Jay and Bob.
BEAUTY
I think they passed out.
GUY
Great. What do we do with them now?
DUDE
Let's cut out their kidneys to sell
on the black market and leave them
in a seedy motel bathtub full of
ice.
BOOKISH
Oh God, not again?
INT. SEEDY MOTEL BATHROOM--NIGHT
Jay lies in a bathtub full of ice, screaming. There's a scar
on his back.
EXT. KANSAS CITY PARK--DAY
Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as
well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see
the scar. It's not there.
JAY
Holy shit, I had a horrible dream.
(looks around)
Yo, I'm hungry. Where can we get
some breakfast?
Bob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points,
and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.
EXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY
An ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob
enter.
INT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME
As the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public
INTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.
JAY
Yo--check that shit out: the Internet.
Let's see if those fucks said
something new about us and that stupid
flick.
Bob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar
and types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look
at the screen and go wide-eyed.
JAY
""Any movie based on Jay and Silent
Bob is gonna lick balls, because
they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely
each other's.""
Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed.
JAY
Eww.
(reading further)
""Yes--they are real people. Real
stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal.""
(to Bob)
Motherfucker! It's time we wrote
something back! Type this shit down.
Silent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates.
JAY
All you motherfuckers are gonna pay.
You are the ones who are the ball-
lickers.  We're gonna fuck your
mothers whole you watch and cry like
little bitches. Once we get to
Hollywood and find those Miramax
fucks who are making the movie, we're
gonna make 'em eat our shit, then
shit our shit, then eat their shit
which is made of our shit that we
made 'em eat. Then all you
motherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay
and Silent Bob.
Silent Bob finishes typing and presses ""Return"". He and Jay
nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking
up at the menu board.
JAY
That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat
our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get
back on the road, get to Hollywood,
and stop that fucking movie from
getting made. No more hairy-bush
nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye
on the prize, and not let nothing--
and I mean NOTHING--distract me.
As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and
freezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all
in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in
the World. She's bathed in light, glowing.
She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.
Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then
at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's
eyes, getting zero response.
JAY'S POV
The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to
her breasts, then down to her crotch.
Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle
of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss
on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager
to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous
with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.
But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to
Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls
his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it
over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She
smiles at the zombified Jay.
GIRL
(off cup)
Oh my God. Do you get free refills
with that?
JAY
Oh, what--this? I just wear this for
protection. You know--so no guys try
to grab my shit.
GIRL
Hi. I'm Justice.
JAY
(dreamily)
And I am so fucking yours--
Silent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze.
JAY
I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my
hereto life-mate, Silent Bob.
JUSTICE
It's nice to meet you.
JAY
Justice, hunh? That's a nice name.
(under his breath, to
Bob)
Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-
U-C-K-I-N-G--
(back to Justice)
So you come here often?
JUSTICE
Oh, I'm not from around here. My
friends and I are taking a road trip,
and we just stopped to grab something
to eat.
JAY
Your friends, hunh? Where they at?
JUSTICE
(pointing)
Out there. By that van.
Jay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other
gorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair
around, looking incredibly sexy.
Without looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--
JAY
Dude--I think I just filled the cup.
INT. VAN--DAY
Jay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the
other Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food
to her friends.
JAY
Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent
Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!
SISSY
Who the fuck are these guys?
JUSTICE
This is Jay and Silent Bob.
(to Jay and Bob)
Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and
Chrissy.
CHRISSY
Where the fuck did they come from?
JUSTICE
I met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch
a ride.
SISSY
I don't know if that's such a great
idea. Jussy.
JAY
Sure it is, Juggs.
MISSY
Oh my god--he just called Sissy
""Juggs""!
CHRISSY
I'm on it.
Chrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.
JUSTICE
Chrissy, no!
Sissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands.
SISSY
We're in the middle of suburbia,
Chrissy. Let's try to act like it.
CHRISSY
}

.

And what-stupid ass little foul-
mouthed bitch-boys don't get their
balls cut off in suburbia?
JAY
(oblivious)
What's with the knife? We having
cake or something?
CHRISSY
Holy shit--he's retarded, to boot.
JAY
(to Silent Bob)
Yo--she called you retarded.
SISSY
(to Justice)
What's wrong with you, Justice? You
do remember where we're going, don't
you?
MISSY
That we do have a job to do?
JUSTICE
They're just gonna tag along for a
few miles. They won't get in the
way, I promise.
(cutesy)
Please?
SISSY
Fine--they can ride with us. But
they're so out of here before we get
to Boulder.
JUSTICE
Honest Injun.
CHRISSY
""Honest Injun""?
(to Sissy)
I can't believe what a pushover you
are.
JAY
And I can't believe fine-ass bitches
like yourselves eat that shit. Don't
you know fast food makes girls fart?
Suddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by BRENT, who's getting
into the van.
BRENT
Say--what's all this talk about
farting?
Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to
sweet and airy, totally switching characters.
SISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY
Hi Brent!
SISSY
This is Brent. He's with us, too.
CHRISSY
Brent, tell these sillies that girls
don't fart.
BRENT
Of course they don't! Only skeevy
stoners fart.
The very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay
and Silent Bob.
BRENT
What up, homies?
(off the Girls)
Wow, Three guys, four girls--
(to Jay and Bob)
What's the count boys?
Jay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes.
EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY
The van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.
INT. VAN--DAY
Brent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and
Bob listen, rolling eyes.
BRENT
Hey there mister science-guy. Don't
spray that aerosol in my eye. For I
don't really want to die. I'm a noble
rabbit!
JAY
What're you guys, like a cover band
or something?
SISSY
We're the Kansas State chapter of
S.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal
Cruelty.
CHRISSY
And we're on our way to Colorado to
give Provasik a piece of our minds!
Everyone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob.
JAY
What the fuck are you bitches babbling
about?
BRENT
Hey! Watch the language little boy.
There are females present.
Jay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts
them.
JUSTICE
Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical
lab where they perform gross
experiments on animals.
JAY
So, what kind of animals are we
talking about here--like bears and
rhinos?
BRENT
No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats...
heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak
for them, who will?
(touches Justice's
arm)
Right, Jussy?
Jay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After
a beat, he relaxes.
JAY
Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you
over here for a second?
Brent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him
confidentially.
JAY
Be honest, yo--you're down with this
for the fine-ass pussy, right?
BRENT
I'm down with this because I love
animals, stupid.
JAY
Even sheep?
BRENT
Of course. Sheep are beautiful
creatures.
JAY
They are beautiful, aren't they?
BRENT
Oh God, yes.
JAY
So then you'd fuck a sheep?
BRENT
What is your damage little boy? You've
got a sick and twisted world
perspective.
JAY
No, you misunderstand me, Prince
Valiant. I mean if you were another
sheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if
you were another sheep?
BRENT
I--suppose so.
JAY
That's what I thought.
(suddenly loudly, to
all)
YO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF
US! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!
EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY
The side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled
out of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as
well, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.
JAY
YA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!
EXT. HIGHWAY--LATER
The van drives down the road.
INT. VAN--SAME
Missy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels
between them.
CHRISSY
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
SISSY
Shut up, I'm thinking.
In the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her,
and she quickly folds them up.
JAY
Is Hollywood near where we're going?
JUSTICE
Is that where you guys are from?
JAY
Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent!
JUSTICE
Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you
all the way out here?
JAY
Well, we couldn't hang in front of
the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of
the strainen-en order, which sucks
ass 'cause it's been like our home
since we were kids. Silent Bob even
busted his cherry there.
JUSTICE
(to Bob)
You did? I'll bet she was a lucky
girl.
Bob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has
strayed.
JAY
Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying
to tell a story here.
JUSTICE
Sorry.
JAY
Anyway, we were talking to Brodie
and he said there's gonna be a
Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we
went to see Holden McNeil, and he
showed us the Internet, and that's
where we found all these fucking
little jerkoffs were saying shit
about us. So we decided to go to
Hollywood and stop the movie from
getting made.  And now we're here.
JUSTICE
Wow. I have no idea what you just
said.
JAY
Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like
animals, huh?
JUSTICE
Sure.
JAY
That's cool. Even snakes?
JUSTICE
You can't exclude an animal just
because it's not cuddly. Of course I
like snakes.
JAY
How about trouser snakes?
JUSTICE
What's a trouser snake?
Just then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder.
JAY DEVIL
(to Jay)
What the fuck are you waiting for?
She went for the setup! Reach in
your fucking pants, and pull yer
cock out, bitch! That's the kinda
shit girls like!
Suddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right
shoulder.
JAY DEVIL 2
Right about here's where the angel's
supposed to show up and tell you not
to pull your dick out. But we bitch-
slapped that little fuck and sent
him packing, so it's smooth sailing.
Let 'er rip, boy!
They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his
hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick,
when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder,
rubbing a swollen jaw.
JAY ANGEL
Sorry I'm late. So what's the deal
here?
(looks down)
Oh, shit--you're not thinking of
whipping your dick out at this fine
piece of woman, are you?
Jay thinks, then nods ""Yes."" The Jay Angel rolls his eyes,
and slaps him.
JAY ANGEL
Tell you what: look at Silent Bob.
See if he thinks it's a good idea to
whip your dick out.
Jay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in
his pants to Jay and shakes his head ""no,"" sternly. Jay
withdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods,
satisfied.
JAY ANGEL
That's it, boy--put the dick down.
You gotta go from the heart, yo. No
little perv bullshit will do for
this one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de
la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the
shit out of two suckerpunching little
bitches. Remember--don't pull your
dick out until she asks you to.
(beat)
Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg!
The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice
looks at Jay, a bit confused.
JAY
Don't ask.
(beat)
So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like
me do to help the animals?
JUSTICE
You really don't want to help us--
JAY
What the fuck are you talking about?
Sure I do. I'd do anything for you.
Justice smiles. Jay tries to recover.
JAY
I mean, youse guys! I'd do anything
for youse guys. For the lift and
shit.
JUSTICE
You sure?
JAY
Sure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I.
Fuck
JUSTICE
Well--okay. Let me talk it over with
the other girls and get back to you.
JAY
You do that.
Jay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.
JAY
I'll be right here.
He winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the
can, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and
winking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly,
then imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.
JAY
Fuck you. Fatty.
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY
The van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls
head toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent
Bob.
JUSTICE
You guys want anything from inside?
JAY
No, we're cool, thanks hon.
Justice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study
the front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a
place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one.
After a beat--
JAY
It just ain't the same, is it? This
place licks balls compared to Quick
Stop.
Silent Bob shakes his head ""Yeah.""
JAY
And speaking of licking balls--how
'bout that Justice chick? She is too
fine.  And she smells so fucking
pretty. She's got a nice voice, too.
And that body?  Smoking. You know,
she never once said ""fuck off,"" when
I was talking to her, or pulled out
the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell
ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY
Justice is at the microwave when she's suddenly surrounded
by the other girls.
MISSY
Smooth move, Justice.
CHRISSY
(slapping Justice
upside the head)
Nice going, Four Eyes!
JUSTICE
Ow!
SISSY
Why the fuck did you let that little
stoner throw Brent our of the van?!
JUSTICE
Oh please--if I had to listen to one
more of those stupid songs, I was
going to throw him out myself.
SISSY
We needed Brent, Justice! He was our
patsy!
JUSTICE
We'll find someone else. Besides, I
didn't see you trying to stop Jay
from throwing him out.
SISSY
Because I didn't want to blow our
cover!
JUSTICE
Cover, shmover--you all hated his
songs, too.
CHRISSY
Not as much as I hate you.
Justice offers Chrissy a cold glance,
CHRISSY
Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone
soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!
SISSY
(rubbing Chrissy's
shoulders)
Don't mind Chrissy. She's just a
little too wound for sound.
CHRISSY
Then how about you help me take the
edge off?
Chrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot
and heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other
customers regard them wide-eyed.
JUSTICE
(to Customers)
They're really good friends.
SISSY
(TO CHRISSY AND MISSY)
Would you two knock it off? We're in
the fucking heartland here! Try to
blend!
JUSTICE
They already do--she's the milkmaid,
and she's the cow.
CHRISSY
Oh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow,
bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your
head off and fuck your spine stump.
SISSY
Enough!
(calm to Justice)
We have a very simple gang here,
Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's
the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl.
But lately, I'm having a hard time
figuring out what you're doing here.
JUSTICE
That makes two of us.
CHRISSY
Shit--your name doesn't even fit the
rhyme scheme.
JUSTICE
That's because very few names rhyme
with ""douchebag.""
CHRISSY
(getting in her face)
You're dancing on my last nerve,
Strawberry Shortcake.
(to Sissy)
You deal with the weak link. I'm
gonna take Missy into the dirty
convenience store bathroom and hate-
fuck the shit out of her.
Chrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go.
JUSTICE
And you said letting them read all
that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to
anything.
SISSY
Don't change the subject. You know
what you have to do now, right? Since
you let our patsy slip away, you've
gotta convince the little kid and
that fat guy to take his place.
They've gotta break into Provasik
now.
JUSTICE
Uh-uh!
SISSY
Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out
of this gang. Just use the little
one's crush to convince him, since
he's so fucking in love with you.
JUSTICE
Jay? No he's not.
SISSY
What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing
your hand back in the van like he
was fucking Lord Byron?
JUSTICE
Well, maybe he was just raised with
manners.
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY
A GIRL walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store.
JAY
(to exited Girl)
YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE
LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?!
(to Bob)
Yeah.
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY
Sissy continues to confront Justice.
SISSY
You're the one that brought the kid
in, Jussy. So you've gotta make
amends.
JUSTICE
Jay is not taking Brent's place as
the patsy.
SISSY
That kid and his quite friend are
our only options at this point. Now
we got about two hours before we get
to Boulder. That gives you plenty of
of time to work on him.
JUSTICE
I'm not gonna do it.
SISSY
Why the fuck not?
JUSTICE
Because he's just to so innocent!
Justice looks out the window and smiles, seeing Jay dancing
alongside Bob.
JUSTICE
Look at him--
EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME
Jay's dancing still, but now we hear what he's SINGING to
Silent Bob.
JAY
I'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little
asshole! Finger-bang and tea-bang my
balls--in her mouth! Where? Where?
In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her
mouth!  Balls, balls, sweaty balls--
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME
Sissy eyeballs Justice, who's still looking out at Jay.
SISSY
Who's it going to be, Jussy--him or
us?
Justice looks at Sissy. Sissy nods at her. Justice looks
back out at Jay.
INT. VAN--DAY
Justice talks to Jay and Silent Bob.
JAY
Steal a monkey? Shit--no problem.
JUSTICE
It's not really stealing--it's
liberating it, and--
(finally hears him)
Wait a second--did you say, ""No
problem""?
JAY
Yeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the
time.
(to Bob)
Right, Lunchbox?
Silent Bob glares at Jay.
JUSTICE
It's not like it's a bad thing. It's
for a good cause.
JAY
Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri--
(takes her hand)
The cause of love.
(kisses her hand,
then releases)
Snoogans--
JUSTICE
What the heck is that?
JAY
What's what?
JUSTICE
""Snoogans,"" I believe it was.
JAY
What the fuck do you think it means?
It means ""I'm kidding.""
JUSTICE
Ohhh. Well, that's too bad.
She smiles at Jay, touches his chin and heads to the front
of the van. Jay plays it cool until she's out of sight, then
humps silent Bob's leg like a dog.
JAY
(singing)
I can't believe I'm gonna get some
pussy for stealing a monkey!
(speaking)
If I'd known it was that easy, I'd've
been stealing monkeys since I was
like seven and shit.
Jay looks at Silent Bob, who clearly disapproves.
JAY
Don't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin
this for me. Me and Justice are gonna
get married one day, so don't be
giving me that ""we-ain't-stealing-no-
monkey"" look.  I'm Morris Day; you're
Jerome, bitch. Don't forget that.
That girl? That girl's in love with
me.
Up front, Justice talks to Sissy, while Missy drives.
JUSTICE
They're gonna do it.
SISSY
Good. They do their part--
(pats a video camera)
And we'll do ours.
Justice eyes Sissy, then slumps in her seat.
EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT
The Van rolls up across the street from the Provasik Labs,
parking in front of another large building.
INT. VAN--SAME
Jay and Silent bob get out, along with Justice. They wear
Ninja masks. Missy and Chrissy follow.
JUSTICE
Remember--we meet back here when
you're done. You sure you're okay
with this?
JAY
As sure as I am that you're the
hottest bitch I ever seen.
Chrissy lunges at Jay, Missy holds her back, dragging Chrissy
away.
JAY
What's twisting that bitch's tits?
JUSTICE
Maybe it's because women don't like
to be called ""bitches,"" Jay.
JAY
They don't? Well how 'bout ""piece of
ass""?
JUSTICE
How about not.
JAY
Well, what the fuck am I supposed to
call you, then?
JUSTICE
Something sweet, you big goof.
Something nice.
JAY
(thinks; then)
Boo-boo kitty fuck.
JUSTICE
(laughing)
Okay.  That's a start.
Sissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming
it at Jay and Bob.
SISSY
Jay, before you go, could you say
something into the camera about the
clitoris.
JAY
What?
JUSTICE
(to Sissy)
Man you are such a bitch--
SISSY
(off Justice; to Jay)
She's just a little embarrassed.
See, Jussy and I are putting together
this documentary for our Human
Sexuality class, and we need a male
perspective on the clitoris.
JAY
The female clitoris?
SISSY
Uh--yeah.
JUSTICE
Jay, you don't have to do this.
She elbows Sissy.
JAY
Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few
things I can say about the clit that
I's like you to hear.
(clears throat; into
camera)
I am the master of the clit! I make
that shit work! It does what ever
the fuck I tell it to do!  No one
rules the clit like me!
(off Silent Bob)
Not this little fuck! None of you
little fucks out there! I am the
clit commander!!! Remember that--
commander of all clits!
Jay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces. Justice shakes
her head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles.
SISSY
Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger.
Sissy climbs back into the van.
JAY
(to Justice)
So--can I get a little kiss for good
luck?
Justice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips.
JAY
So--can I get a little blow job for
good luck?
Justice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off,
revealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in
midair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out.
Justice watches them go.
SISSY
Jussy. C'mon.
Justice climbs back into the van.
INT. VAN--SAME
Justice sits, glaring at Sissy.
SISSY
Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my
authority again, you lose your fucking
fronts, you got that?
JUSTICE
Yes, sir.
Sissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to
Missy, beside whom is a bag full of high-tech equipment.
SISSY
Phase One, down. While we're executing
Phase Two, you edit that tape and
grab a new car.
MISSY
No sweat.
SISSY
Let's suit up.
EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT
Jay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn,
stopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN
out of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly
gives the ""metal"" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame.
INT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT
It's dead quiet and still. Then, the pair smash through a
window, landing in the floor in a ball. They lift their Ninja
hoods. Jay glares at Silent Bob.
JAY
You fat fuck--
INT. VAN--NIGHT
Missy peers through binoculars out the window.
SISSY
They in?
MISSY
You can say that.
SISSY
Time to shine. Let's go.
EXT. VAN--NIGHT
The quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look
at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black.
They head for a SEPARATE BUILDING.  Stopping at the front
door.
Sissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures
elaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers
Sissy a look.
JUSTICE
You are so gay.
Chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a
digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four
different digits. The door lock CLICKS open.
SISSY
Once we're inside, I want complete
silence.
(holding up high-tech
device)
Missy whipped this up. It counts our
decibel level. If it goes into the
red--alarm, we're dead. So not even
the slightest noise, got it?
Justice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed
closely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one
last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay
and Bob.
SISSY
(pokes her head back
out)
Justice! Move your ass!
Justice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads:
BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE.
INT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT
Jay and Bob stand there, looking around the room.
It's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking
ANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his
eyes and hits him.
JAY
Stay frosty, you big fucking softie.
We've got a job to do.
Silent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade
through the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on
the wall. Inside it, there's a pistol.
JAY
Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal
tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up
like Percocets!
Jay elbows the glass, breaking it. He takes the gun out and
tosses it to Bob.
JAY
Hold this. Later, me and Justice can
shoot each other with it and fuck
like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg.
Silent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat. The
pair look through the cages, until HEAR the distinct SOUND
OF A MONKEY. Jay directs Silent Bob's flashlight to the cage
from where the sound emitted. He smiles.
JAY
(reading)
""Suzanne."" Boo-yah.
INT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT
The three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway. At the
other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.
Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays
the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor,
which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly,
within the mist, laser beams become apparent.
Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few
steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs
forward and does an impressive series of flips down the
hallway, not touching a single laser beam.
Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.
Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of
the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture
to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series
of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.
Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.
Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to
Chrissy.
Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams,
Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.
Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are
even more impressive than the other two, including running
up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes
the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice,
arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud,
manly FART.
The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING
through the building.
CHRISSY
Holy fuck--the little stoner was
right--
Sissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds. She ours
them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed
by Justice and Chrissy.
EXT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT
The Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy
pulls up in a CONVERTIBLE.
CHRISSY
Boom Box!
Missy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races
toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the
convertible.
SISSY
I can't believe it. Months of planning
and it's all blown by a fucking fart.
JUSTICE
We can't just leave them like this!
That alarm's gonna bring the cops
here any minute!
SISSY
That was always the plan, Justice!
They take the heat off of is long
enough until we can get out of town!
Chrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van.
CHRISSY
Kaboom, you little stoner fucks.
The girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into
the car with them.
CHRISSY
It's set. Let's roll.
The convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there.
The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting
down from two minutes.
INT. PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT
Jay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something
seems to move inside it. The head for the exit, but Silent
bob hesitates, offering a sad look to the animals in all the
cages. Jay hits him.
JAY
What the fuck are you looking at?
There ain't no snacks here, man! Now
we got what we came for, so let's
get the fuck out!
Silent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes
his head frustrated.
JAY
Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck
are we supposed to do about it?
Silent bob offers Jay a look.
EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT
The front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob
(carrying their bag), and HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS--cats, dogs,
birds, rabbits. All race off into the night.
Jay and Bob race toward the van. Jay screams at it.
JUSTICE
JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS!
Suddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks.
JAY
Oh shit--
Three COP CARS screech up, the van between them and Jay and
Bob. The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay
looks to Bob, pissed
COP
DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS
EXPLOSIVE!
The counter on the device attached to the van hits ""0,"" and
the van BLOWS UP.  Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one
direction, the Cops in the other.  On all fours, Jay looks
at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye.
JAY
Justice--
We crane up from him as he bellows--
JAY
JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!
Silent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still
carrying the bag.
EXT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY
We start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife
Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a DEPUTY
opening the door and heading inside.
INT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY
The Deputy enters just as a FAX is coming through at an
operations board. He rips it off, reading it. His eyes go
wide.
DEPUTY
Oh, fudge...
(calling off)
Marshal Willenholly!
INT. BATHROOM--SAME
MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY sits on the bowl, staring at Four Legged
Law-Man magazine, eyeing it lustily. Below frame, he jerks
off.
WILLENHOLLY
Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby--
It takes two hands to hold doesn't
it--?  Uhhh--
As he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him.
WILLENHOLLY
WHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING!
DEPUTY (O.S.)
Sir, we got a report of a break-in
at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing
lab.
Willenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine.
There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants.
WILLENHOLLY
Have you read this article on the
mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I
wish that was in our jurisdiction--
I'd shut down every last one of those
ass-cock chuggers, personally.
The Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then
at Willenholly.
WILLENHOLLY
What? ""Ass"" means ""donkey.""
DEPUTY
Yes, sir.
(hands him a fax)
WILLENHOLLY
(looks at fax)
Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the jet.
DEPUTY
We don't have a jet, sir. And
Boulder's only ten minutes away.
WILLENHOLLY
Then gas up the next best thing.
EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--DAY
There are FIRE TRUCKS all over the place now. The burned out
van is being poured over by Cops. Just then, Willenholly
pulls up on a MOPED. He parks it and surveys the wreckage.
WILLENHOLLY
My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats
out?
(thinks)
Wait--is that right?
COP 1 (O.S.)
Excuse me--who the hell are you?
Willenholly rips down the Velcro patch on his jacket,
revealing a badge.
WILLENHOLLY
Federal Wildlife Marshal. This
investigation is now under my
jurisdiction.
COP 1
Oh really? And why is that?
WILLENHOLLY
Because someone let a whole mess of
animals out of their cages, sir.
COP 1
Well, we believe that was just a
diversionary tactic used to call
attention away from the real heist
over here at the Diamond Exchange.
WILLENHOLLY
Yeah, right. That's a believable
scenario. It sounds more like
something out of a bad movie.
Willenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another
COP joins them.
COP 2
Sir, the Provasik people say they've
rounded all their animals up, except
for one: an orangutan.
WILLENHOLLY
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our
fugitive has been on the run for 6
hours!  Average simian foot speed
over uneven ground--barring injuries
or preoccupation with tire tubes,
mites or bananas--is four miles an
hour. That gives us a radius of twenty
miles.
COP 3
(calling out from
crowd)
Twenty-four, sir!
WILLENHOLLY
What?
COP 3
Six hours times four miles an hour
is twenty-four.
WILLENHOLLY
(doing the math in
his head)
Yes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty-
four miles. Now what I want out of
all of you is a hard target search.
COP 4
Excuse me, sir?
WILLENHOLLY
Yeah?
COP 4
What does that mean, exactly--a ""hard
target search""? What's a ""hard
target""?
WILLENHOLLY
Well. It's--a target--that's--hard.
Anyway--
COP 4
So are you referring to the search's
level of difficulty? Or is the hard
target the monkey?
COP 3
Or the people who stole the monkey?
The COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of
""Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,""etc.
Willenholly rubs his temples.
WILLENHOLLY
Okay, how about this? What I want
out of all of you is a thorough search
of every gas station, residence,
warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,
outhouse, and doghouse in that area!
Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!
COP 1
Wouldn't it make sense to put them
up at every twenty-four miles--seeing
as that's how far they'd have gotten
in the last six hours?
They begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly
looks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.
WILLENHOLLY
This is so frustrating. It's just so
hard sometimes--
(yelling)
YOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO
FIND HER!
Another COP joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope.
COP 5
Sir, this was just delivered to the
station.
WILLENHOLLY
What is it?
COP 5
It's a tape from the terrorists who're
claiming credit for the break-in.
WILLENHOLLY
Is it VHS or Beta? You know what--
never mind. Do you have a VCR?
INT. OFFICE--DAY
Willenholly and the Cops stare at the O.C. TV, shocked, as
the video ends.
WILLENHOLLY
Oh my God--
(without looking up)
Have the jet gassed up and ready to
go at a moment's notice.
COP
Sir, we don't have a jet; just a
helicopter.
WILLENHOLLY
(dialing his cell
phone)
Doesn't anybody have a jet anymore?
(into cell phone)
Plafsky? It is Willenholly. You gotta
get me on the national news, pronto.
Why?!  Because we may very well be
dealing with the two most dangerous
men on the planet!
EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY
Jay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at--
SUZANNE (the ORANGUTAN)--who sits on a log across from them,
staring back.
JAY
This is Jussy's monkey
(to Suzanne, angrily)
JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY
FUCK!
Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. Jay and
Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and
pulling back as if he's going to strike.
JAY
(to Silent Bob)
Do something. Tons of Fun!
Silent Bob offers the ape a weak wave. Suzanne drops her
hands from her face and waves back. Jay cranes his neck to
see over silent Bob.
JAY
Is that fucking thing waving at us?
Suzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at
the ape.
JAY
Holy shit? That monkey understood
us! Maybe it's some sort of super-
monkey!
Suzanne offer them a ""raspberry."" Spitting as if the comment
was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at
this.
JAY
What the fuck was that for? It's not
a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo?
Suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, ""Congo stunk."" Silent
Bob smiles in agreement and amusement. Jay looks at him,
stung.
JAY
You're my bitch. You get my back.
Don't go joining this chimp's side.
Jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. Silent
Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers.
JAY
Yo--what if there's more super monkeys
up in the lab? Maybe they're making
an army of 'em up there! Holy shit!
Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the
X-Files Roswell--style!
JAY'S DELUSION: We enter into JAY'S HEAD and see--
INT. LAB--DAY
We PAN over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids
in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching
blueprints for an insidious war machine. An orangutan shakes
hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which
looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files.
JAY (V.O.)
Working in secret with a crew of
double-dealing, nicotine-fiending
fucks that're selling out the human
race, these supermonkeys will use
simian science and their genius IQ's
to make man and monkey alike believe
that they're the superior species!
EXT. BALCONY--DAY
A monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of
apes, who wave fists in the air.
JAY (V.O.)
Then all it'll take is one little
monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the
dumber chimps into a frenzy, until
they go all ape-shit and start
demanding more bananas, better pay,
and human flesh!
EXT. FIELD--DAY
Randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield,
and is shot in the neck. He collapses, revealing a GORILLA
on horseback holding a rifle. Two other Gorillas throw a net
over him.
JAY (V.O.)
You'll have to be faster than Walt
Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior
gorillas, who hunt humans for sport,
profit, and the occasional inter-
species blow-job. And if you don't
wind up with a monkey hog in your
mouth, you'll be captured, killed or
worse...
INT. LAB--DAY
Cornelius and Zera-looking chimps dissect the brain of a
living, screaming, Dante.
JAY (V.O.)
Eaten alive!
EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY
The Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like
atmosphere. Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of
bananas. The sign now reads: Ape Stop
JAY (V.O.)
Then these monkey fucks'll start
wearing our clothes and rebuilding
the world in their image.
EXT. BEACH--DAY
We start on a FULL SHOT of Jay on the beach, looking up,
then SNAP ZOOM OUT to REVEAL Jay kneeling before the beach
buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised.
JAY (V.O.)
And only those who outwit those damn
dirty apes'll ever remember that it
was MAN who once ruled the earth!
JAY
(at statue)
YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN
YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!!
WE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO:
EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY
Another close-up of Jay's painted face. Behind him, Suzanne
and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake. Jay eyes Suzanne
angrily.
JAY
Not on my watch, motherfucker!
Jay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously.
JAY
DIE, YOU SUPER-MONKEY FUCK! DIE!!!
Jay trips on a root poking out of the ground and hits the
dirt. Suzanne then goes over to Jay, pulls his face to hers,
and kisses him on the lips.
JAY
Alright--you can live. For now.
Silent Bob helps Jay to his feet.
JAY
You see that? Bitches love me.
(heading off)
Besides--we're in the fucking clear,
yo. It's not like anyone knows we
stole the monkey.
INT. TV NEWS STATION--DAY
An ANCHORMAN addresses the camera.
ANCHORMAN
I'm Reg Hartner and this is a News
Now bulletin. A Provasik animal
testing facility in boulder was the
focus of an attack by a terroristic
primate rescue syndicate calling
themselves the Coalition for
Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers.
Or simply, C.L.I.T.
A graphic of the C.L.I.T. logo appears beside him, nailing
home the joke.
ANCHORMAN
In a videotape sent to authorities
this morning, credit for the
liberation of an orangutan from the
lab last night is taken by these men--
A VIDEO CAPTURE of JAY and SILENT BOB from pre-break--in
appears on screen.
ANCHORMAN
--identified in literature that
accompanies the tape as Jay and Silent
Bob. In this chilling clip, they
make it very clear that they are in
control of the C.L.I.T.
On screen is the C.L.I.T. Logo. A digitized voice narrates.
DIGITIZED VOICE
We are the C.L.I.T. None of you are
safe. Now tremble before the might
of our merciless leader.
The logo gives way to the video of Jay and Bob that Sissy
shot before the Provasik break-in. Jay's yelling into the
camera.
JAY
I AM THE CLIT COMMANDER!!!
Coming out of the video footage, the Anchorman shakes his
head, chilled.
ANCHORMAN
Terrifying. Here to help us understand
this footage is Federal Wildlife
Marshal Willenholly.
PULL OUT to reveal Willenholly beside the Anchorman.
ANCHORMAN
Marshal, what can you tell us about
the C.L.I.T.?
WILLENHOLLY
From the intelligence we've been
able to gather, we've discovered
that the C.L.I.T. is a tiny offshoot
of the L.A.B.I.A.
ANCHORMAN
The Liberate Apes Before Imprisoning
Apes movement.
WILLENHOLLY
Exactly. The men you saw in the video
are believed to be the masterminds
responsible for the frenzied C.L.I.T.
activity last night. They go by the
obvious code names ""Jay"" and ""Silent
Bob.""
(to camera)
If you should come across them or
any other C.L.I.T.-ies, please--
exercise extreme caution.
INT. POTZEK'S INC. OFFICE--NIGHT
On the TV screen is Willenholly and the video capture of Jay
and Silent Bob.  Holden looks up from his drawing table,
shocked.
ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
(from TV)
Marshal, how do you respond to
allegations that Federal Wildlife
Marshal's Office allowed the C.L.I.T.
to slip through their fingers?
WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
Nonsense. We're all over the C.L.I.T.,
Reg.
HOLDEN
(shakes his head)
Nights like this, I miss dating a
lesbian.
INT. QUICK STOP--NIGHT
From behind the register, Dante and Randal stare at the TV,
slack-jawed.
ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
(from TV)
Is there also speculation that Jay
and Silent bob may be responsible
for the Diamond Exchange jewel heist
that occurred in the same vicinity
of downtown Boulder last night?
WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
There's nothing to suggest that, no.
But these men are still to be
considered very dangerous.
RANDAL
(to Dante)
I told you that restraining order
was a good idea.
EXT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOMS--SAME
On the second-floor terrace of a run-down, roadside motel,
Sissy, Missy and Chrissy dance in their undies and drink
champagne. On the first floor terrace below, Justice leans
against the open sliding glass door, watching the news report
on a TV inside the room with the volume turned way up.
ANCHORMAN
(on TV)
Is that your cell phone?
WILLENHOLLY
(on TV)
Yes, Excuse me.
(on TV, into cell
phone)
Federal Wildlife Marshal. I'm on my
way!
(shuts phone; to
anchorman)
We got 'em. They're in Utah.
(to camera)
Citizens of Utah--steer clear of the
C.L.I.T. Stimulation of the C.L.I.T.
is not recommended.
Justice turns the TV off and yells up to Sissy.
JUSTICE
Your tape worked. The news is all
about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik
break-in, with almost no mention of
the Diamond heist.
SISSY
(yelling down to
Justice)
I told you those two were the perfect
patsies. Now we lay low for awhile--
just in case--and start planning the
next job.
JUSTICE
Don't you feel any regret? Jay and
Bob don't deserve this. They were
really sweet.
CHRISSY
The only thing I regret is not gutting
that little trout-mouthed prick like
a fish and playing Twister with his
vitals.
MISSY
You are so nasty.
CHRISSY
I'll show you nasty, you little slut.
SISSY
Would you two get a room?
CHRISSY
Fine--we'll take yours.
(getting up in Sissy's
face)
I am gonna stain your sheets, bi-
otch.
Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls
her eyes.
SISSY
Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.
JUSTICE
They're your gang.
SISSY
Oh and not yours? You know, I don't
get you, Justice. You used to be all
about the girl stuff: stealing,
boning, blowing shit up. Now you're
like this little priss with a
conscience. It's really a fucking
drag.
JUSTICE
We all gotta grow up some time.
SISSY
If moping around over some little
boy you're crushing on is being grown-
up, then pass me my Wonder Woman
underoos.
JUSTICE
Don't you feel the least bit of guilt
for what we did to those guys?
SISSY
Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty
about setting up her boyfriend? Then
how about taking a shower?
Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace.
They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY
GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas.
PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
You the gals that ordered the pizzas?
SISSY
This dopey bitch ordered the large
plain, but I could go for some hot,
thick, Sicilian.
PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
No charge, lady.  He rushes into the
motel, Justice sighs, looking up at
the stars.
JUSTICE
(quietly)
I'm sorry, Jay.
INT. DINER--DAY
Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay
chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne
digs into a banana split.
JAY
You know, Justice died trying to
save this monkey, so maybe we should
keep her around. That way, we can
honor her memory.
Silent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their
food.
JAY
Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing
all sentimental, and you're all about
a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't
you glad we stopped to eat?  And you
were all piss-scared the cops'd bust
us or something. You know what I
say?
(singing, a la NWA)
VOICE (O.S.)
(via bullhorn)
THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE
KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH
YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER
THE ORANGUTAN!
Jay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat. Then--
JAY
You think they're talking to us?
EXT. DINER--DAY
There's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling
at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other
COPS.
SHERIFF
YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY.
(to other COPS)
Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty.
Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind
the car, gun drawn.
SHERIFF
The ape.
WILLENHOLLY
What?
SHERIFF
An orangutan's a member of the great
ape family. It's not a monkey.
WILLENHOLLY
Look, who's the Federal Wildlife
Marshal here?
(into bullhorn)
JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL
WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR
C.L.I.T.  DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.
SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY,
AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT!
INT. DINER--DAY
Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth,
like scared rats.
JAY
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Go out there and give 'em the monkey.
Silent Bob looks to Jay, shocked.
JAY
Oh, what, man? I said that shit before
I knew they were gonna shoot us!
Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't
takin' no bullet for no monkey!
Bob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears. Jay
rolls his eyes.
JAY
Oh, brother--this is like something
out of fucking Benji! Look man, maybe
it's not that bad back at the lab!
Maybe they experiment on 'em by,
like making 'em fuck a bunch of
different, good-looking monkeys. We
don't know! Maybe they got it real
sweet!
Suzanne shakes her head ""no."" Bob points to her, as if she's
strengthening his point.
JAY
(to Suzanne)
You stay out of this, you weepy little
chimp!
(looks around thinking)
Fuck man, I ain't no strategist!
You're the guy that makes the
blueprints! I don't even have the
fucking smarts of a little--
Jay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth. There's
a little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded
sweatshirt and a baseball cap.
JAY
--kid
EXT. DINER--DAY
Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The
Sheriff looks on.
WILLENHOLLY
ANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY
BETTER HIT THE DECK!  WE'RE GOING TO
OPEN FIRE!
(to cops)
Everyone has bullets in their guns,
right?
Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between
them (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed
up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the
diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face.
It's a pretty piss-poor disguise.
JAY
Don't shoot! We're just trying to
take our son out of this hostile
environment!
From behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly.
SHERIFF
Their ""son""?
WILLENHOLLY
Maybe they're one of those gay
couples?
Jay seizes on the idea. Silent Bob nods fervently.
JAY
Yeah! We're gay! And this is our
adopted love child! We're not from
around here!  Don't make us go back
to our liberal city home with a tales
of prejudice and bigotry in the heart
of Utah!
(whispers to Bob)
You see the shit I gotta put up with
for you! Now I got this guy thinking
I'm gay!
WILLENHOLLY
Oh God, this is the last thing I
need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals
shooting their mouth off in the
liberal press that the Federal
Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes
gays.
SHERIFF
ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY
BE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON!
THAT'S THE APE!
WILLENHOLLY
You see this badge?  I think I'd
recognize an ape if I saw one. And
the only thing I do recognize here
is a political fiasco I'm, going to
avoid by letting this butt-fucking
Brady Bunch go!
Jay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by--
JAY
And I'll tell you another thing:
what if that guy shows up around the
stores one day and starts telling
everybody you and me are poo-gilists?
How are we gonna get any pussy then,
hunh?
WILLENHOLLY (V.O.)
YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS!
Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked. They look
back out at Willenholly, who's yards away. Jay points at
himself, as if to say, ""Me?""
WILLENHOLLY
(via bullhorn)
YES, YOU, SIRS.
JAY
(calling over)
So we can just go?
WILLENHOLLY
(via bullhorn)
Yes, sir--or ma'am. Please accept my
apologies for detaining you and your
unorthodox-but-constitutionally-
protected-family unit.
SHERIFF
(amazed)
Un-fucking believable.
JAY
I'd like to offer a big gay thank-
you, sir. We'll tell all our gay
friends that Utah is Gay friendly
country for gays who are gay.
WILLENHOLLY
I'm sure Utah appreciates that. You
might also want to make it clear
that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's
Office is also pro-'mo as well.
(winks at the sheriff)
And might I add, that's one fine-
looking boy you're raising.
JAY
Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm.
See, I knocked up a hot woman friend
of ours who I also fuck on the side.
So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But
my tubby husband here is one hundred
percent queer. He loves the cock.
WILLENHOLLY
He certainly looks insatiable.
JAY
'Bye
WILLENHOLLY
'Bye
Jay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road.
Willenholly and all watch them go. The Sheriff is livid.
WILLENHOLLY
Well, it's not my way--but damned if
there doesn't go one happy family.
(balloon two)
Now, we just shoot some tear gas
into that diner, and when the two
guys run out with the monkey, we'll--
Willenholly suddenly freezes, thinking. He looks to the
Sheriff.
WILLENHOLLY
That was the them, wasn't it?
EXT. ROAD--DAY
Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne are laughing.
JAY
I said you ""love the cock""! I gotta
be the craftiest motherfucker alive!
GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now
in full panic mode.
Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing.
Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets.
JAY
FLEE, FAT-ASS, FLEE!!!
EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY
The trio race across what looks like a bridge (but isn't),
shots still ringing out. Jay spots a manhole. He points at
it, screaming.
JAY
HEAD FOR THE SEWERS!
Silent Bob pops the cover off, With bullets ricocheting all
around them, Jay leaps into the manhole.
INT. SEWER TUNNEL
Jay lands in a sewer tunnel (like in The Fugitive). Suzanne
lands on top of him.
JAY
Take your stinking paws off me, you
damn dirty ape!
(yelling up)
YO LUNCHBOX! HURRY UP!
EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY
Bullets hitting the pavement around him, Silent bob dives
into the sewer grate as well, but--
INT. SEWER TUNNEL
Silent Bob gets stuck. Jay rolls his eyes.
JAY
You fat fuck.
Silent Bob struggles while Jay and Suzanne try to pull him
through the hole.
JAY
You just--had to--order pancakes--
didn't ya?
EXT. DAM ROAD--SAME
CLOSER on the running Willenholly and Sheriff.
WILLENHOLLY
Fire a warning shot into that bulbous
ass!
SHERIFF
One rectal breach, coming up!
INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME
Jay and Suzanne pull with all their might. Bob strains.
JAY
SUCK IT IN! THINK THIN! THINK THIN!!!
EXT. DAM ROAD--SAME
TIGHT on the Sheriff, as he squints to aim.
SHERIFF
Open up and say ""ahhhhh,"" you stoner
sumbitch--
INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME
TIGHT on Silent Bob bellowing.
SILENT BOB
AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!
EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY
The Sheriff's gun fires.
INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME
Jay and Suzanne fall backwards, as Silent Bob pops through.
JAY
INCOMING!!!
SILENT BOB
AAAIIIGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!
SUZANNE
OOOOOOOOO!!!
EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY
The bullet ricochets off the curb, as Silent Bob's feet slip
through.
INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME
Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne are in various states of
collapse. Jay and Bob look up at the hole.
JAY
Just like Winnie-the-Pooh.
EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY
Willenholly and the Sheriff arrive at the manhole.
WILLENHOLLY
Wow! That was an incredibly daring
escape!
(to Sheriff)
You must see that a lot, hunh?
SHERIFF
Shut up!
WILLENHOLLY
Sire, you're very taciturn.
Willenholly starts rolling up his sleeves as the sheriff
looks on.
WILLENHOLLY
You and your men stay up here. When
I corner them, I'll call you for
back-up.
SHERIFF
What're you doing? They're trapped.
The only way they can get out of
there is right here.
WILLENHOLLY
A Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn't
wait for his prey to come to him. He
comes to it. Or goes to it. Is it
""comes to it"" or ""goes to it""?
(shakes it off)
I'm going in there. I'm counting on
you Sheriff.
Willenholly embraces the Sheriff.
WILLENHOLLY
You've taught me so much.
Willenholly then climbs into the sewer, disappearing. The
Cops look at the Sheriff for a beat, who heads O.C. saying--
SHERIFF
Fuck this asshole. Let's go back to
the station and get some donuts.
INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY
TIGHT on Jay, Bob, and Suzanne, looking into the distance,
bathed by natural light. We HEAR the loud sounds of water
rushing.
JAY
This reminds me of the night I fucked
your mom, yo. One big-wet, smelly,
gaping hole, and me wishing I had a
board tied to my ass--
PULL BACK to reveal Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne standing at
the precipice of the sewer tunnel that pokes out of a DAM.
Water rushed below.
JAY
--to keep from falling in.
WILLENHOLLY
PUT THE MONKEY DOWN AND YOUR HANDS
UP!
Willenholly aims his gun at the trio's backs.
WILLENHOLLY
MISTERS, DO YOU WANNA GET SHOT?!?
Our heroes comply, but Jay speaks.
JAY
LOOK MAN--SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO
BACK! THEY'RE EXPERIMENTING ON HER!
(beat)
AND FOR THE RECORD, I AIN'T REALLY
GAY!
WILLENHOLLY
I DON'T CARE!
(beat)
AND FOR THE RECORD, I KNEW THAT WASN'T
REALLY A LITTLE BOY.
JAY
SURE, FOR ONE MORE RECORD--
(pointing to Silent
Bob)
HE LOVES COCK!
WILLENHOLLY
ON YOUR KNEES!
Jay and Silent Bob face Willenholly and kneel. But Suzanne's
still looking out of the dam.
JAY
See, man?! He's lining us up like
fucking circus seals! Well, I'm going
first--I don't want no mouthful of
monkey-spit when I gotta blow this
fucking G-Man.
TIGHT on Suzanne, who's looking down at the raging water
below. Her brow hardens with purpose.
TIGHT on Suzanne's right hand grabbing Jay's right hand.
TIGHT on Suzanne's left hand grabbing Bob's left hand.
Suzanne leaps forward at us, pulling Jay and Silent Bob
backwards.
JAY
GET OFFA ME!!! GET OFFA ME!!!
EXT. DAM--DAY
Suzanne leaps from the mouth of the tunnel, dragging Jay and
Bob with her.
JAY AND BOB
AAAAIIIGGGGGHHHHH!!!
INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY
Willenholly goes wide-eyed, holstering his gun.
WILLENHOLLY
Oh, no--think you can pull a Peter
Pan on me?!
He races toward the mouth of the tunnel and leaps out as
well.
WILLENHOLLY
AAAIIIGGGGHHHHH!!!
EXT. DAM--DAY
As Willenholly plummets, he passes Suzanne hanging by her
feet off a pipe that pokes out from beneath the mouth of the
tunnel. She's hanging upside down, holding Jay and Silent
Bob's hands.
JAY
HEY LAW-DOG! SEE YOU IN HELL, COCK--
SMOKER!!!
EXT. DAM BOTTOM--DAY
Willenholly plummets toward the water below and ker-splashes
into the drink.
EXT. DAM--DAY
Suzanne has pulled Jay and Silent Bob back into the mouth of
the tunnel.
JAY
You see that shit? Damn--remind me
not to get on the monkey's bad side.
Yo--boost her up. So we can talk, so
we can get the fuck out of here.
Silent Bob lifts Suzanne over the tunnel onto the--
EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY
--pavement near the manhole. She sits there, looking down.
EXT. DAM--DAY
Silent Bob lifts Jay over the top of the tunnel toward the
road,
EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY
Suzanne sits by the side of the road. A car pulls into the
shot.
Jay and Silent Bob climb over the cliff onto the highway
just in time to see--
The passenger door slamming on a TRUCK with Los Angeles plates
and a sign that reads CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD. Suzanne is
looking out the back window waving.  Jay and Bob leap to
their feet, chasing after the truck.
JAY
HEY! GET THE FUCK OFF HER, MAN! THAT'S
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S MONKEY?!
The truck speeds away in the distance. Jay and Silent Bob
stand there, panting.
JAY
Man! Who the fuck just steals a
monkey?!
Silent Bob indicates themselves.
JAY
Oh yeah.
(pissed)
Well this fucking blows! We got one
more day to stop those fucks from
making that movie, and someone goes
and takes the only thing I had left
from the one woman I ever loved enough
NOT to try to stick my hand down her
pants!
Silent Bob mimes that they should go after Suzanne.
JAY
Go after the monkey? How the fuck
are we supposed to know where that
thing's going?
Silent Bob mimes in the direction the car went. Jay stares
at him.
JAY
What? What is that supposed to mean?!
Don't just fucking point like--
(imitates him)
You ain't the broad in the Children
of a Lesser God. Use you fucking
mouth for more than eating, ya tubby
bitch!
Bob starts an elaborate pantomime. Jay tries to guess what
he's saying.
JAY
You gotta take a shit? No--you gotta
take a salad? Take a salad? What the
fuck are you trying to say?
Bob's on the verge of tears, trying to mime out his message.
JAY
JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY?!?
Silent Bob grabs Jay and screams into his face.
SILENT BOB
THE SIGN ON THE BACK OF THE CAR SAID
CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD, YOU DUMB
FUCK!!!
Bob releases Jay, breathing heavily and storms off in the
direction of the car went. Jay watched him go for a beat,
then follows, muttering under his breath--
JAY
Say it, don't spray it, bitch.
EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE--DAY
AN ESTABLISHING SHOT.
SHERIFF (O.S.)
""And might I add, that's one fine-
looking boy you're raising.""
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE--DAY
The Sheriff and his men stand around, eating donuts, laughing.
The Station doors slam open, and Willenholly enters, soaking
wet. All the Cops stare at him.
SHERIFF
Well, if it isn't the wildlife
experts. Did you come to it or go to
it?
WILLENHOLLY
Do you have a microwave here, Sheriff?
SHERIFF
We have a toaster oven. Why?
WILLENHOLLY
Because I need to dry my gun out so
I can SHOOT YOU WITH IT ! TWICE!
SHERIFF
This might cheer you up.
(hands him paper)
Your office just faxed this over.
Guy there say it's a post from an
Internet chat board, signed by a
""Jay and Silent Bob."" Your man thinks
it's a lead as to where those fellas
are taking the ape.
WILLENHOLLY
(reading)
""All you motherfuckers are gonna
pay. You are the ones who are ball-
lickers.  We're gonna fuck your
mothers while you watch and cry like
little bitches. Once we get to
Hollywood--""
(looks up)
They're going to Hollywood.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD--MONTAGE
We take a quick visual tour of the city, including the sign,
the line of front of Krispy Kreme, the line in front of Coffee
Bean and Tea Leaf, the Simpson star in the Walk- of- Fame,
the Rocky and Bullwinkle statue, the Beverly Center, Jerry's
Famous Deli, the Hollywood and Vine sign, Mann's Chinese
Theatre, the Star Wars footprints outside of Mann's, the
Chateau Marmont, people on cell phones, Trashy Lingerie.
HOOKERS propositioning a potential JOHN, and finally--
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD--DAY
We start on the street sign, and PAN DOWN to a JEEP WRANGLER
that pulls up. A gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives, with
Silent Bob sitting in the back seat.  After a beat, Jay pops
up from under the dash, wiping his mouth, looking around.
The Woman sighs, and zips up her pants. Jay and Bob hop out
and wave to the Woman as the car pulls away. Bob offers Jay
a look.
JAY
What? It's not like it's cheating.
Justice blew up.
Two HOOKERS approach them.
HOOKER 1
Hey, little man. You want some of
this?
HOOKER 2
How about you, Big Boy?
HOOKER 1
If you've got fifty bucks we can get
nasty.
JAY
Oh yeah? How nasty?
HOOKER 2
As nasty as you wanna be, poppie.
JAY
Alright--first, I'll want to tongue
your bung while you juggle my balls
in one hand and play with my asshole
with the other. But don't stick you
finger in.  Then. I'll wanna pinky
you and put it in your friend's brown,
while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie
cup. After that, I'll wanna smell
your titties, for a while, and you
can pull my nutsack up over my dick,
so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I
want you to flick at my nuts while
your friend spanks me into the same
Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in. Then
we throw the Dixie cup out.
The Hookers look at him, dumbfounded, Then--
HOOKER 1
Oh, that's it honey. I quit.
(walking away)
This job just passed the point of no
return.
HOOKER 2
(to Jay)
You one fucked up puppy, poppie.
JAY
(watching them go)
What?! You said 'nasty'?
(shakes his head; to
Bob)
Man, chicks in Hollywood are so stuck
up.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.--LATER
Jay and Silent Bob walk.
JAY
Alright, here's the plan: first, we
find out where they're shooting that
movie at. After we shut that shit
down, we can start looking for the
monkey. But before we do any of that
shit, we gotta find a motherfucker
in the know. Someone who's like, the
mayor of Hollywood.
They pass a DEALER leaning against a wall, trying to make a
sale.
DEALER
(subtly)
Crack? You want some crack? Sweet-
ass rock. Get you high.
JAY
No man, but you want some weed?
DEALER
(beat)
You on the job?
JAY
(pulling out a card)
Yeah, boy. Jersey Local 408.
CLOSE ON THE CARD.  It reads: UNITED JERSEY BROTHERHOOD OF
DEALERS, LOCAL 408.
There's a graphic of a stoner beside it.
DEALER
I'm Los Angeles Local 305!
They shake hands, slapping each other on the back like Union
brothers.
DEALER
You guys got medical in Jersey yet?
JAY
Shit, no, we might have to strike in
September.
DEALER
Norma Rae like a motherfucker. You
gots to get your benefits, you know
what I'm saying?
JAY
I hear that. Yo--maybe you can help
us out. You know where they're
shooting a movie around here.
DEALER
You in this town and you gonna ask
that question? Be a little more
specific.
JAY
It's a Miramax flick. We gotta bust
it up so people stop calling us names
on the Internet, even though they're
not really talking about us but these
characters based on us, and at the
same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who-
got-killed-in-a-car-explosion's
monkey.
Jay exhales. The Dealer stares at him for a beat.
DEALER
I don't know that the fuck you just
said, little kid. But you touched a
brother's heart, so I'm gonna help
you out with some directions to the
studio.
JAY
You know where Miramax is at?
DEALER
Fuck, yes. Miramax accounts for
seventy-eight percent of my business.
INT. E! ENTERTAINMENT NEWS--DAY
After E! news logo plays. CUT TO STEVE KMETKO in studio.
STEVE KMETKO
Is Hollywood ready for Jay and Silent
Bob?  A source at the Federal Wildlife
Marshal's Office tells us a posting
was pulled off an Internet movie
chat board that was allegedly written
by the two domestic terrorists
themselves. It's sending a shockwave
through Hollywood. Jules Asner's on
the scene at Miramax Studios, Jules?
Jules Asner is in front of the Miramax Studios main gate.
JULES ASNER
Steve, the tenor of Tinseltown is
one of terror today, after the Federal
Wildlife Marshal's Office learned
that hot, new terrorists Jay and
Silent Bob are targeting Miramax
Studios for their next campaign of
blood, violence and monkey-theft. In
the posting, pulled off Movie Poop
Shoot.com, the gruesome twosome
threatened, quote--
(reading)
""Once we get to Hollywood and find
those Miramax Expletive-Deleted who
are making the Bluntman and Chronic
movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our
Expletive-Deleted, then Expletive-
Deleted, which is made up of our
Expletive-Deleted, then eat their
Expletive-Deleted, which is made up
of our Expletive-Deleted that we
made 'em eat. Unquote. So far, we
haven't been able to get a statement
from anyone here are the studio.
BACK TO STEVE in the E! Studio.
STEVE
Jules, word has it that Ben Affleck
and Matt Damon are on the lot,
shooting a super-secret project.
Have you seen then roaming around?
BACK TO JULES at Miramax Studios.
JULES
No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck
buying a soda at a concession stand
earlier.
STEVE
But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?
JULES
None whatsoever. However, to be fair,
all the feds have to work with is
murky videotape, so no one's even a
hundred percent sure what Jay and
Silent Bob look like, exactly. For
all we know, they could already be
on the lot.
As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her,
looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera
and start waving behind Jules.
INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM--DAY
Justice goes wide-eyed, seeing Jay and Bob on E! She hops
out of her seat.
JUSTICE
Oh my God! Jay! No!
Justice looks around, panicky. Her eyes fall on--
The diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table.
Justice looks at the diamonds, then the TV screen. She thinks
for a beat, then--
JUSTICE
Fuck it.
She pours the diamonds into the satchel, and shoves it in
her pocket.
INT. SEEDY MOTEL BEDROOM--DAY
The door slowly opens in the dark bedroom, and Justice crawls
to the bedside table, reaching for a set of keys. In the
bed, Missy and Chrissy make out under the sheets, moaning.
Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity.
Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place. As
she crawls back out, we PUSH IN on the note, which reads:
SORRY, GUYS--BUT I LOVE HIM.
EXT. SEEDY MOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY
The convertible skids out, taking off.
INT. SEEDY MOTEL HALLWAY--DAY
There's a loud scream, then Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy rush
down the stairs (in varied states of undress and sheet-wrap).
Wiping their mouths. Sissy holds Justices's note.
SISSY
That bitch!  That fucking, fucking
bitch!!!
(to girls)
Get dressed. We're going after her.
CHRISSY
Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet.
SISSY
Which is more important to you: a
fortune in diamonds or busting a
nut?
Sissy and Missy race back up the stairs. Chrissy stands there
still, shrugs, then digs her hand into her panties.
SISSY (O.S.)
Chrissy! Now!
CHRISSY
Fuck--
Chrissy races back up the stairs.
EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS-DAY
The E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main
gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's
just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then
lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob.
JAY
We gotta play this right.
Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard
booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle
and giving chase.
EXT. STUDIO LOT--DAY
Jay and Bob race around the building toward what looks like
an open alley then smash into it, falling down. The open
alley is a background painting that's being moved by some
SCENICS. Jay and Bob get up, shaking off the impact.
JAY
I hate how fake Hollywood is.
The SECURITY GUARD catches up to them now, grabbing them by
their shoulders, spinning them around.
SECURITY GUARD
Where do you think you're going?
JAY
GET OFFA ME! RAAAAAPE!!!
SECURITY GUARD
This is L.A., sir. We don't rape our
suspects in custody. We just beat
them.
(into walkie-talkie)
Echo Base, I've got a ten-o-seven
here: two unauthorizeds on the lot.
Request back-up.
VOICE
(from walkie-talkie)
I thought that was a ten-eighty-two.
SECURITY GUARD
No, sir--a ten-eight-two is the code
for vanishing a dead hooker from Ben
Affleck's trailer.
VOICE
(from walkie-talkie)
Oh, that Affleck. Backup on the way.
JAY
Hey! I make you a deal: this guy'll
suck your dick off if you let us go!
SECURITY GUARD
Contrary to what you believe, not
everyone in the movie business is
gay.
JAY
Well, how about this deal: he sucks
my dick while you watch and jerk
off.
The Security Guard stops, looks around, then releases them,
reaching into his pants.
SECURITY GUARD
Alright. But make is fast. And sexy.
Silent Bob looks at Jay, wide-eyed and scared.
JAY
Dude, it's either this or jail. And
you know what they make you do in
jail.
Silent Bob wells up with tears, slowly dropping to his knees,
reaching for Jay's pants. The Security guard bends down low
to watch at crotch-level. Suddenly, Jay hammers his two fists
into the Security Guard's neck, knocking him out.  Silent
Bob falls into a sitting position on the ground, relieved.
Jay looks at him.
JAY
Well what are you waiting for, bitch?
Start sucking. Bunnggg!
(looking around)
Alright--where they shooting this
movie at?
Silent Bob points behind Jay, at the SOUNDSTAGE they're in
front of. There's a LINE OF PEOPLE waiting at the door.
JAY
Worth a shot. Like a shot in the
mouth, you gay bitch. Eww, dude--you
were really gonna suck my dick.
Silent Bob shakes his head ""no,"" wide-eyed as Jay heads off.
When Jay's out of frame, Silent bob shrugs like, ""Yeah--I
guess I was.""
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY
Jay and Bob approach the line, as an A.D. calls out to the
crowd.
A.D.
Alright--bar extras. Follow me.
The A.D. starts leading the crowd in. Jay and Bob blend in
and follow inside.
EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY
An official-looking car tears down the road.
INT. CAR--SAME
Willenholly drives, dialing his cell phone.
PHONE VOICE
Federal Bureau of Investigation
WILLENHOLLY
Yes, this is Federal Wildlife Marshal
Willenholly. Can I speak with Agent
Sid Enmarty, please?
PHONE VOICE
One moment, please.
INT. AGENT ENMARTY'S OFFICE--SAME
AGENT SID ENMARTY works at his desk.
SPEAKER VOICE
Agent Enmarty? A Marshal Willenholly
calling.
AGENT SID
(perking up)
Holy shit! Yeah, put him through.
(calling off)
YO! INCOMING BITCH BOY PHONER!
Two other AGENTS rush in, chuckling. All gather around the
phone as Sid presses the speaker button.
AGENT SID
Willenholly?
BEGIN CROSS-CUTTING WITH WILLENHOLLY.
WILLENHOLLY
Sid? Hey, buddy. I'm calling because
I could really use your help on this
killer case I'm working.
AGENT SID
I'll bet, Will. What's it this time...
Beaver trouble? Some kind of
unauthorized marsupial trafficking?
The agents crack up, stifling their laughter.
WILLENHOLLY
(taking it in stride)
No, no--nothing like that. Say--there
aren't other people listening in,
are there?
AGENT SID
No way, man. It's just me and you
talking here.
WILLENHOLLY
Good. I'm tracking a monkey down
that's on it's way to Los Angeles,
and I could use some bureau backup.
AGENT SID
Los Angeles, hunh? Maybe we should
stake out Clint Eastwood's place.
Didn't he used to drive around with
a monkey that'd punch people and
drink beer?
The Agents crack up. Willenholly's catching on.
WILLENHOLLY
Am, uh--Am I on speaker phone?
AGENT SID
No way--Dunston!
WILLENHOLLY
Alright, now that's not fair. I know
I didn't make it as high up as you
guys, but my job's just as important.
AGENT SID
Calm down, Will. Don't go all...
bananas on us!
The Agents crack up even more, Willenholly's pissed.
WILLENHOLLY
I come to you as a friend--as a fellow
professional--and this is the shit I
get?!
AGENT SID
You're right, Will. Tell you what--
we'll get our best man on your case
right away. You might've heard of
him. He's a doctor.
WILLENHOLLY
(excited)
Oh, a doctor?
AGENT SID
His name's Doctor Zaius!
The Agents laugh hysterically, pounding the desk, Willenholly
tears up, enraged.
WILLENHOLLY
SCREW YOU GUYS!
Willenholly throws his cell phone across the car, the mocking
laughter still emitting from it. Willenholly cries.
EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS LOT--DAY
The Red Light FLASHES outside the soundstage.
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME
Jay and silent Bob stand amidst a line of EXTRAS. Silent Bob
looks O.C. goes wide-eyed, and pokes Jay, pointing O.C. Jay
looks and sees--
A COLLEGE BAR set that looks like the College Bar from Good
Will Hunting, complete with CLARK (the stuffy college jerk).
MATT DAMON stands off to the side, loosening up for the scene.
BEN AFFLECK calls to the O.C. DIRECTOR.
BEN
Where are we taking it from, Gus?
Gus Van Sant sits off to the side, counting a stack of money.
He just shrugs.
GUS
I'm busy.
BEN
You're a true artist, Gus
MATT
Just take it from ""It's a good
course.""
BEN
Oh, now you're the director.
MATT
Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let's
remember who talked who into doing
this shit in the first place. Talking
me into Dogma was one thing, but
this--
BEN
I'm sorry this is taking you away
from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses-
who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely-
flick you're supposed to be doing
this week.
MATT
Oh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you
never saw Forces of Nature?
BEN
You're like a child. What've I been
telling you? Sometimes you've gotta
do the safe picture. Sometimes, you
do it for art. Sometimes, it's the
payback picture your friend says you
owe him--
They take a beat and look at the camera. Then--
BEN
And sometimes, you go back to the
well.
MATT
And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games.
BEN
Now that's just mean.
Jay turns excitedly to Bob.
JAY
This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick,
'cause that's those two fucks from
that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do
is figure out a way to get close to
them--
The A.D. grabs Jay and Bob by the arms and drags them onto
the set, placing them near Ben and Matt in the scene.
A.D.
Just stand there and react. Don't
say anything.
Bob goes a little wide-eyed. Jay smiles at him.
JAY
(off A.D.'s comment)
That's pretty funny.
A.D.
(calling out)
Alright, people. Lock it up. Let's
go for picture.
Jay and Bob eye Ben and Matt fiercely, Ben and Matt are
oblivious.
JAY
On the count of three, we rush those
fucks and beat the shit out of 'em.
'Cause if they're all fucked up,
they can't make the move, right?
Alright, then.  One--two--
CLAPPER/LOADER (O.S.)
Good Will Hunting Two: Hunting Season.
Jay and Bob freeze and look at each other, then O.C.
The Clapper/Loader holds a clapboard in front of Ben's face.
It does indeed, read: Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season.
CLAPPER/LOADER
Scene sixteen, take five.
The Clapper/Loader claps the board closed and races off. Ben
looks to Gus.
BEN
Action, Gus?
Gus looks up from counting his money.
GUS
Jesus, Ben--I said I'm busy.
Ben shakes his head and then starts the scene with CLARK.
BEN/CHUCKIE
You should check it out, it's a good
course. But, you know, frankly, I
found the class rather elementary.
CLARK
You know, I don't doubt that it was.
I remember that class. It was just
between recess and lunch.
BEN/CHUCKIE
Are we gonna have a problem, again?
CLARK
There's no problem. I was still just
hoping you might give me some insight
into the evolution of the market
economy in the Southern Colonies.
See, Wood says--
MATT/WILL
(stepping in)
What'd I say? Didn't I say you'd be
back here regurgitating Gordon Wood.
But you forgot about Vickers--
CLARK
No, I just read Vickers, so I'm up
on inherited wealth, Hunting. But
you're not the angry, brilliant young
mind you once were, just itching to
vent your frustrations.
In the background, Jay and Silent Bob get bored and head out
of the shot. After a beat, they get pushed back in by the
A.D.
CLARK
Once Sean told you it wasn't your
fault, you lost the edge, William.
You stopped hitting the books with a
vengeance, and now I've read shit
you haven't even heard about yet.
Face facts, my friend--love made you
a soft little pussy boy, unable to
stand up to an academic showdown,
like you used to. You're just no
longer that good--Will Hunting.
(gets in his face)
Now how do you like them apples?
Matt/Will turns away angrily, facing Ben/Chuckie, looking
downwards, steaming.
BEN/CHUCKIE
I don't like the sound of them apples.
Will, what're we gonna do now?
MATT/WILL
Chuckie--
(snarling)
It's Hunting season.
Matt/Will spins to face Clark with two huge guns in his hands.
He blows Clark away, Jay and Bob hit the deck. Matt/Will
stands there, guns smoking.
BEN/CHUCKIE
Apple sauce, bitch.
Suddenly the door to the soundstage swings open, and the
Security guard Jay knocked out rushes in, followed by other
SECURITY GUARDS who comb the place.
SECURITY GUARD
Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a
ten-oh-seven on our hands.
BEN
Wait a second! I wasn't with any
hookers today!
The Security Guard sees Jay and Bob crouched behind Ben, He
points, screaming.
SECURITY GUARD
THERE THEY ARE!
Ben and Matt turn to Jay and Bob, Jay smiles.
JAY
Affleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms,
yo.
Jay and Bob then race out-of-frame, closely followed by the
Security guards.  Matt head off, arms thrown in the air.
MATT
If anyone's looking for me, I'll be
in my trailer trying to figure out
how I got here from an Academy Award.
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY
Jay and Bob rush out, pulling a bench in front of the door,
blocking it. They race ten feet to another soundstage across
from them and head inside a door.
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME
Jay and Silent Bob rush in to see--
Wes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar-
looking GHOSTFACE KILLER and SHANNEN DOHERTY. The
Clapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4
CLAPPER/LOADER
Scream four, scene thirty-seven,
take one.
(claps it and rushes
off)
WES CRAVEN
Action!
The Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff,
until she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out.
SHANNEN DOHERTY
Alright, you bastard! Let's see who
you really are!
Shannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal
SUZANNE.
Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed.
SHANNEN DOHERTY
Fucking Miramax--
(getting up)
CUT!
Shannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask.
WES CRAVEN
Shannen, usually I say ""cut.""
SHANNEN DOHERTY
A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't
even trying anymore, are you?
WES CRAVEN
The market research suggest that
people love monkeys.
Jay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne.
JAY
WE LOVE THIS MONKEY!
They rush out. West shrugs to Shannen.
WES CRAVEN
See?
Security Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair.
EXT. LOT--DAY
Jay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne.
On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting.
The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until--
At the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four
Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking
their path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the
other Security Guards gaining.
JAY
What the fuck are we gonna do?
Just then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the
bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front.
Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and
jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling
away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse.
Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart.
JAY
PUNCH IT!!!
Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the
vehicle, taking flight,
Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as--
Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front
basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a
soundstage) a la E.T.
Jay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then
they look ahead and let out a scream.
The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage
Building.
INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY
The Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling
onto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see.
JAMES VAN DER BEEK AND JASON BIGGS dressed as Jay and Silent
Bob, looking down as them.
JAMES
Holy shit--that looked like it hurt.
JASON
Are you guys alright?
(off Suzanne)
Hey! They've got a monkey!
Jay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other.
JAY
Yo, I think that shit just kicked
in.
JAMES
Let's get you guys on your feet.
James and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet. All
stare at one another, perplexed,
Then--
JAY
(to James)
See man?  Its never, ""Hey--you were
in Loser, or, ""Dude--you rocked in
Boys and Girls."" It always comes
back to that fucking pie! I'm haunted
by it.!
JAMES
Well, you put your dick in a pie,
dude--
JASON
Enough!
(to Jay)
Jason Biggs.
JAY
Yo-you really get to third base with
the Russsian chick like you did in
the movies?
JASON
You mean Shannon? Sadly, no.
JAY
She's fucking hot, man. If I was
you, I'd been like--
Jay mimes a series of sexual maneuvers. Jason and James look
on, bewildered.
JAY
(off James's-look)
What, man? You never did one of these?
Jay starts miming again, and suddenly stops, staring at James,
blown away.
JAY
Holy shit? You're the Dawson!
JAMES
It's James, actually. James Van Der
Beek.
JAY
Yo, what's up with Pacey stealing
Joey away from you? If I was you, I
would've drowned his ass in your
Creek and shit!
JAMES
I know, Because what--is Josh better
looking than me? Fuck, no. I mean,
who on earth is better looking that
me? I ask you.
JAY
Joey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did
you ever get to third base with her?
JAMES
Well, there was this one time--
(catching himself)
Wait a second--who are you guys?!
JASON
They're our stunt doubles, dumbass.
(to Jay)
Right?
JAY
Stunt doubles for what?
JAMES
The movie we start shooting in a few
minutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike
Back.
JASON
(to Bob)
You're doubling me. I'm playing
Bluntman, AKA Silent Bill.
JAMES
Bob
JASON
Right. And he's playing Chronic. AKA
Ray.
JAMES
Jay! Shit, did you even read the
script?
JASON
There's a script?
Jay and Bob stare at them, blankly. Then Jay puts up his
finger, indicating they should wait a minute. He gets into a
huddle with Silent Bob and Suzanne.
JAY
These are the guys who are playing
us, yo. We take them out, and bickety-
bam! No movie.
Silent Bob nods at Jay, then Suzanne. Suzanne heads off,
leaving Jay and Bob to huddle.
JASON
(off Jay and Bob, to
James)
What's with the weird, gay huddle
going on over there?
JAMES
What's gay about it? It's two guys
talking in a corner. Man--why are
you such a homophobe.
JASON
I'm not a homophobe.
JAMES
You are. You're always calling things
gay. ""Ooo--look at the gay huddle,
dude!""
Suzanne approaches them.
JASON
Hey--look at the monkey.
JAMES
Next you're going to tell me the
monkey's gay.
JASON
He's so cute--
(to Suzanne)
C'mere. Monkey. C'mere--
Suzanne pulls Jason and James out of the frame.
While Jay and Silent Bob continue to huddle, the sounds of a
beating are heard, O.C.
JAY
Alright, here's what we do: start
swinging, and don't stop until those
young Hollywood fucks are out of
commission. Ready? Break!
Jay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide-
eyed. Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied
and beaten and knocked out cold. She holds her hands skyward,
clasped like a champion.
JAY
That's one funky monkey.
Suddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room.
VOICE (O.S.)
Mister Biggs?  Mister Van... Der--
Beek? This is Security. We've got a
pair of intruders at large, and they
crashed through a window we thought
might be yours.
JAY
(to door; deepening
voice)
Uh--yeah. They're in here.
SECURITY GUARD
Do they have you hostage? Should we
call your publicists?
JAY
NO! I mean, we kicked those guys'
asses bad. They're--knocked out.
EXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME
The Security Guards stand outside a door marked James.
SECURITY GUARD
Great work, sirs! If you let us in,
we'll take over--
JAY (O.S.)
(through door)
NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in
here! Together!
The Security guard look at one another.
SECURITY GUARD
Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the
door, sirs.
The Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job
face to the rest.
INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY
Bob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it
and hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods,
and starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the
vent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet.
JAY
What the fuck are we gonna do?! How
are we gonna get out of here without
them seeing us?
Silent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet,
smiling.
EXT. LOT--DAY
The Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a
waiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and
Silent Bob.
JAMES
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!
JASON
HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M
THE PIE-FUCKER.
SECURITY GUARD
(to Cops)
He'll be the pie--in prison.
INT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY
Jay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits).
JAY
This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In
these outfits we're totally incognito.
Suddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders.
A.D.
Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek?
Great--you've changed costumes
already. Let's get you to set.
(pulling them off)
The director doesn't like to be kept
waiting.
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET
It looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side,
near the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs
the hustling, white crew.
DIRECTOR
Look at all these crackers, Seventy
million dollars and I can't even get
a black grip?
A white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director.
P.A.
Here's your coffee, sir.
DIRECTOR
(eyes the coffee)
You spit in this?  Because I know
all you white folks are pissed off
that the studio'd entrust a multi-
million dollar to a brother.
P.A.
I didn't spit in it, sir.
DIRECTOR
Then taste it! Go on!
The P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it
back to the Director.
P.A.
It's all good, sir.
DIRECTOR
No it ain't all good. Oh, you think
I want it now, after your lips touched
the cup? Get the fuck off my set!
P.A.
You the man, sir.
DIRECTOR
No you the Man! And that's the
problem!
The Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously
skulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches.
BANKY
Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky
Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and
Chronic. We met a few weeks back.
I'm the executive producer.
DIRECTOR/CHAKA
Oh--you're the executive producer,
hunh? Well go ""produce"" me a latte
no white folks spit in--okay Fucky?
BANKY
Banky. I just wanted you to know
that I respect your work as an artist.
I'm something of an artist myself. I
was the inker on the comic book.
CHAKA
An inker? What, like you trace?
Banky's face drops as the A.D. joins them.
A.D.
Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the
set, Chaka.
CHAKA
I don't see 'em. Where are they?
(into bullhorn)
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE STARS OF THIS
PIECE OF SHIT?!
On the Bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake
rock. Smoke pours in, and Jay and Silent Bob--now dressed as
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC--step from the darkness. Jay and Bob
survey the set, amazed.
JAY
This must've set 'em back a couple
hundred bucks.
CHAKA
Look at this shit.
(off their outfits)
A gay hood ornament, and the color
Purple.
JAY
Who the fuck are you?
CHAKA
Who the fuck am I? I'm the fucking
director, is who I am. Chaka Luther
King. The creator of all of this.
JAY
Wait a sec--I thought Holden and
Banky created this shit.
CHAKA
And I'm stealing it. I'm taking it
back for all the shit you people
have stolen from us! Did you know, I
came up with the idea for Sesame
Street before PBS? I was going to
call it N.W.P.--Niggaz with Puppets.
(beat)
Alright--enough small talk. Let's
shoot it.
Chaka heads back toward his monitor. Jay and Bob are confused.
JAY
Wait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna
direct us?
CHAKA
I'll be directing you to the food
stamps line after I fire your ass,
if you talk back like that to me
again!
JAY
But we don't know what we're supposed
to do here. We didn't even read the
script.
CHAKA
So? Neither did I. Shit, neither did
the studio.
(pointing O.C.)
Look man, it's not hard. In this
scene, the bad guy breaks into the
Bluntcave.  You make up some shit,
fight him for a while, I film it, I
yell ""cut,"" and then head back to my
trailer, where I got more white women
waiting for me there than the first
lifeboat off the Titanic!
(confidentially)
They all want a part of the movie,
and I got just the part for 'em.
Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off.
CHAKA
LET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!
A.D. (O.S.)
QUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!
Chaka climbs behind his monitor. The P.A. is waiting for him
with another cup of coffee.
P.A.
I got you another cup of coffee,
sir. Spit free.
Chaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down.
The Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and
Bob, getting ready.  After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob.
CLAPPER/LOADER
I just wanna say that I loved when
you fucked that pie.
(calling off)
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK,
SCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!
The clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off. From
behind the monitor,
Chaka calls out--
CHAKA
ACTION!
Jay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for
a beat. Then--
JAY/CHRONIC
Uh--Snootchie Bootchies.
Suddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit
the deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the
arch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic.  He's a normal-looking
man with huge, overgrown FISTS.
JAY/CHRONIC
What the fuck?
COCK-KNOCKER
You thought I'd never find your
precious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp
Knight? But now you and your sidekick
are finally in the grasp of Cock-
Knocker!
JAY/CHRONIC
Why do they call you ""Cock-Knocker""?
Cock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls.
Jay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a
vibrator-looking device from his cape.  He presses a button
on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a
light saber.
COCK-KNOCKER
Any last words before I bust your
balls, Bluntman?
Silent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--
A wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the
placard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE.
It's out of his reach.
Silent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his
hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.
Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip.
The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive
pose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair
start light saber dueling.
CHAKA
(from behind monitor)
Damn! Now that was one special effect!
This picture's gonna make House Party
look like House Party Two!
A.D.
Or House Party Three?
CHAKA
Shut the fuck up!
Cock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive
blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the
ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He
lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock-
Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on
his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver
a saber kill-shot, when we hear--
JAY (O.S.)
YO-BITCH-FISTS!
Cock-Knocker turns to see--
Jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a
double-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la
the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One).
JAY
Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg.
Jay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong
Saber.
CHAKA
(from behind the
monitor)
I think George Lucas is going to sue
somebody--
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY
Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a
shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside
the flashing red light.
WILLENHOLLY
(looking around)
So, this is Hollywood?
(suddenly full of
purpose)
Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent
Bob.
Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY
The door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two
shots, O.C.
WILLENHOLLY
FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!
Willenholly goes wide-eyed.
It's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a
kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a
Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare
back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking
bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.
WILLENHOLLY
Oh my God--
(to kids)
Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a
warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm
on the wrong, uh--wrong set.
The Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the
O.C. Willenholly.
KID
You killed Mooby--
(to Kids)
LET'S GET HIM!!!
The Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as
he's attacked.
INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME
Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.
COCK-KNOCKER
(breaking character)
You are not upstaging me, Van Der
Beek!
Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker,
hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear
reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade
the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other
hand.
COCK-KNOCKER
(to O.C. Chaka)
CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A
""CUT""!
On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's
huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire).
Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber,
Jay grins at Cock-Knocker.
JAY
Now whose balls have been busted,
bitch?
Suddenly, a gun shot rings out.
All turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun
first on Jay, then Bob.
WILLENHOLLY
The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and
Silent Bob!
(revealing badge:
calling out)
Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal
Wildlife Marshal. These men are the
leaders of a terrorist organization
wanted for the abduction of a monkey.
VOICE (O.S.)
They didn't really steal that monkey.
All turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows.
Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.
JUSTICE
It was just a diversion so we could
steal these.
Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing
them.
JUSTICE
And they're not the leaders of
C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.
WILLENHOLLY
No--the clit's real. The female orgasm
is a myth.
JUSTICE
(to Jay)
Are you guys alright?
JAY
I thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty
Fuck.
JUSTICE
(smiling)
You remembered.
(back to business)
It was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy,
Chrissy, and I are international
jewel thieves. We were setting you
up as a patsy, but I couldn't go
through with it, because I... because
I love you.
JAY
Yeah? So that means you'll fuck me,
right?
VOICE (O.S.)
If she does, it'll be considered
necrophilia.
All turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the
shadows, guns drawn.
SISSY
Because she's gonna be one dead bitch.
(to Justice)
Hi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad
time?
MISSY
You should've just let these guys go
down, Jussy.
JAY
Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was
waiting until I got to know her a
little better. See, there was this
little angel on my shoulder, and he
said--
CHRISSY
Shut the fuck up before I shoot you
where you stand in your pansy red
booties.
JAY
(looking down)
Holy shit, I am wearing pansy red
booties!
(to Bob)
Man--why the fuck didn't you tell
me?
SISSY
Let's have those diamonds, Jussy.
JUSTICE
I can't do that, Sissy
SISSY
(points her gun at
Jay)
Then lover--boy gets one in the brain.
CHAKA
YO!
All turn to look at Chaka.
CHAKA
Would any of you lovely ladies like
a private audition to be in my movie?
Justice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on
the ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and
running for cover.
Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.
Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed
craft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start
firing at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren
craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented
can of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are
out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and
reload. From behind his table,
Willenholly yells--
WILLENHOLLY
WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M
JUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!
CHRISSY
TWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING,
TALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!
MISSY
AND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.
WILLENHOLLY
ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!
The Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire
again.
Chaka ducks behind the monitor.
CHAKA
A shitload of white people with guns?
Time to get my black ass out of here!
He races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each
other defensively, striking kung fu poses.
SISSY
You really let me down, Justice.
Throwing it all away for a little
stoner with bad pronunciation.
JAY (O.S.)
HEY!
JUSTICE
(ignoring him)
What's it gonna be, Sissy? Which
fighting style do you want me to
kick your ass in?
SISSY
Are you kidding me? I taught you all
all your moves myself. There's not a
style you can bust that I can't defend
against.
JUSTICE
You're no match for my ""Shaolin Monk.""
SISSY
Yeah, but I can bury you with my
""Crouching Tiger.""
JUSTICE
A little ""Venus's--flytrap""?
SISSY
I'll counter with ""Dragon Crane.""
JUSTICE
How about a little ""Bitch, My Man
Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy""?
SISSY
(beat; smiles)
Bring it on.
Justice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch
into a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and
screaming.
Behind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.
JAY
Yo--I hope one of 'em rips the other
one's shirt off and we see some tit.
Both Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins
them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.
BANKY
Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I
just wanted to say hi. I'm--
JAY
Banky fucking Edwards! Just the
motherfucker we came to see!
BANKY
(shocked)
Holy shit! What the fuck are you
guys doing here?!
Sissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the
floor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.
BANKY
Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?!
JAY
All these assholes are calling us
names on the Internet, 'cause of
this stupid movie!
BANKY
I feel for you boys--I really do.
Those Net snipers can be really cruel.
But Miramax paid me a shitload of
money for Bluntman and Chronic, so
it occurs to me that people bad-
mouthing you on some web-site is
none of my FUCKING CONCERN!
SILENT BOB
Oh--but I think it is.
Banky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes.
JAY
Here we go again--
SILENT BOB
Shut the fuck up.
(to Banky)
We had a deal with you on the comics
for likeness rights. And as we're
not only the artistic basis but also
the character basis for your
intellectual property, Bluntman and
Chronic, when we said property was
optioned by Miramax Films you were
legally obliged to secure our
permission to transfer the concept
to another medium. As you failed to
do that, you're in breach of the
original contract--ergo, you find
yourself in a very actionable
position.
Banky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a
beat, Jay adds--
JAY
Yeah.
Justice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head
and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.
BANKY
So, what do you guys want, to go
away and take your lady friends with
you?
JAY
Shitcan this movie so we don't get
called names on the Internet anymore.
BANKY
Even if there's no movie, people are
still free to talk shit about you on
the Internet. That's what the
Internet's for: slandering others
anonymously.  Stopping the flick
isn't going to stop that!
In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the
air.
JAY
Well this isn't fair!  We went to
Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole
a monkey, we got shot at, and got
punched in the motherfucking nuts!
We ain't leaving empty-handed!
On cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.
JAY
What's up baby? You look good!
BANKY
Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy?
JAY
Oh yeah.
(pushing Sissy off
him)
Get the fuck offa me, pig!
Sissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair.
Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.
BANKY
You guys are gonna ruin my movie
career.
JAY
Well, we want something for our mental
anguish.
BANKY
Tell you what: we'll settle this
monetarily. I'll give you half of
what I made.
JAY
Half?!?
BANKY
Half's not good enough?  Fine--I'll
give you two-thirds of what I made!
JAY
Fuck-you--you already said half? You
can't take it back!
Silent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand.
BANKY
Done
Justice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing
each other.
SISSY
Your shit is so tired, Justice!
JUSTICE
Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!
Justice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage.
Sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop
Missy and Chrissy, knocking them out.
Willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.
WILLENHOLLY
Hello? Truce?
(beat)
I think I killed both of them.
Suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing
a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind
him, holding the gun up in the air.  Justice surveys her
handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.
JUSTICE
C'mon guys. It's over.
Jay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her.
JAY
Yo, I was just about to jump in there
and get your back.
Then, the SOUND of SIRENS rings out in the distance.
JAY
Holy shit, the cops! We gotta get
out of here!
JUSTICE
No. I'm tired of running.
Justice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps
his face.
JUSTICE
You awake, Marshal? Marshal?
WILLENHOLLY
(tries to move but
can't)
Oh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey
shot me in the ass and paralyzed me!
Oh the irony!
JUSTICE
(off Suzanne's gun)
You're not paralyzed. It was just a
tranquilizer.
WILLENHOLLY
Jesus! Tranqued by a little monkey!
My friends in the Bureau are never
gonna let me live this down!
JUSTICE
You have friends in the F.B.I.?
WILLENHOLLY
(crying)
They all made it in, but I failed
the exam. Why the hell else do you
think I became a Federal Wildlife
Marshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!
Justice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking.
Then--
JUSTICE
Maybe not. I can make you a deal
that'll get you into the F.B.I.,
regardless of test scores.
WILLENHOLLY
What kind of deal?
JUSTICE
You drop the charges against Jay and
Silent Bob and say you never found
the ape.  Make sure the world knows
they're not in control of any C.L.I.T.
JAY
Now wait a second--
JUSTICE
I'll explain later, Jay
(to Willenholly)
In exchange, I'll give you the
diamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy,
Missy, Chrissy, and myself. But I
want a reduced sentence.
WILLENHOLLY
You'd be willing to do that?
JUSTICE
(off Jay)
For him? I'd be willing to do
anything.
Justice stands and takes Jay by the hands.
JUSTICE
I'm an international jewel thief
who's facing a jail sentence.
JAY
That's alright. I'm a junkie with a
monkey.
JUSTICE
If I go to prison, will you wait for
me?
JAY
I don't know. Will we fuck when you
get out?
Justice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately. The kiss should
say it all, but--
JAY
Don't change the subject. Will we
fuck when you get out?
JUSTICE
Snoogans.
Justice and Jay kiss again.
Suzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up. She grabs
his face and kisses him.
Willenholly looks to Banky.
WILLENHOLLY
Wow. There's a lot of love in the
room.
BANKY
Regardless of what you may have heard.
I do not kiss guys.
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--LATER
Justice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls
her away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.
WILLENHOLLY
Sorry, Justice. We've gotta go.
(to Jay: friendly)
Hey--stop stealing monkeys.
JAY
Fuck you.
WILLENHOLLY
Fair enough.
Willenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the
car.
JUSTICE
(to Jay)
Wait for me.
JAY
What--here?
Jay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away,
leaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking
down the lot.
BANKY
Well, boys--you're rich in love--
(indicating Jay)
Well, you're in love. And to top
that off, you've got your own monkey.
What more could two guys from Jersey
possibly want?
JAY
All those fucks to stop talking shit
about us on the Internet, for
starters.
BANKY
What do I keep telling you? There's
not much you can do to stop that.
Well, short of showing up at all
their houses and beating the shit
out of them, I guess.
Jay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and
smile.
JAY
(to Bob)
You know--with all that money we're
gonna make we can buy a lotta plane
tickets.
START THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE
EXT. SKY--DAY
A passenger JET flies through the sky.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY
Jay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check
the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod
at each other, and cross the street.
INT. HOUSE--DAY
The doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent
Bob standing in the doorway.
MOTHER
Can I help you?
JAY
Yes. Ma'am, Does--
(reading of paper)
William Dusky live here?
MOTHER
Yes. He's my son.
JAY
May we talk to him, please.
MOTHER
One moment.
She walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes
to the door.
KID
Yeah?
JAY
Yo--do you post as--
(reading off paper)
Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com?
KID
Yeah.
JAY
And did you write ""Fuck Jay and Silent
Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses?
KID
Yeah, a while ago. So?
Jay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him
outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front
lawn.
EXT. SKY--DAY
The passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite
direction.
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY
Jay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers.
They speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the
door.
JAY
On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say
Jay and Silent Bob--
(reading off paper)
""--are fucking clown shoes. If they
were real, I'd beat the shit out of
them for being so stupid.""
KID
(chuckling)
Yeah.
JAY
Really--
Again, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit
out of him.
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY
Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a CLERK.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY--DAY
Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a WOMAN.
EXT. RECTORY--DAY
Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a PRIEST.
INT. OFFICE--DAY
Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a BUSINESSMAN.
EXT. MOVIE THEATRE--NIGHT
The marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE
BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC!
WORLD PREMIERE!
The front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see
DANTE and RANDAL.
RANDAL
Now that was worse then Clash of the
Titans.
DANTE
I still can't believe Judy Dench
played me.
RANDAL
Hey--remind me to renew that
restraining order.
DANTE
Why?
RANDAL
Because I'm gonna blast the flick on
the Internet tonight.
STEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.
STEVE-DAVE
Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent
comic book movie?
WALT
Tell'em Steve-Dave!
STEVE-DAVE
Would you stop saying that?
ALYSSA and TRISH come out.
TRISH
Well, that was just another paean to
male adolescence and its refusal to
grow up.
ALYSSA
Yeah, sis--but it was better than
Mallrats. At least Holden had the
good sense to keep his name off of
it.
TRISH
Why wouldn't Miramax option his other
comic instead? You know--the one he
drew about you and him and your
relationship?
ALYSSA
You mean Chasing Amy? That would
never work as a movie.
BANKY and HOOPER exit.
BANKY
I'm so fucking embarrassed--
HOOPER
Honey, you should be. They took your
characters and reduced them to one
ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was
like watching Batman and Robin again.
BANKY
Thanks. That means a lot coming from
the guy who pretends to be Shaft as
opposed to the guy who takes shaft.
HOOPER
I don't hear you complaining nightly.
In fact, the only thing I do hear
you say is ""Yes, Hooper! Cradle the
balls and work the shaft!""
BANKY
(looking around)
Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in
public!
A guy behind them calls out to Banks.
GUY
Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!
BANKY
(recognizing him)
You--!
GUY
That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm
back for round two!
Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him,
while Hooper tries to break them up.
WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a
prison uniform.  They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.
WILLENHOLLY
You know, I don't get out to the
movies much. But I'd have to say
Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!
JUSTICE
Are these leg cuffs really necessary?
WILLENHOLLY
Don't make me shoot you, Justice.
And finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.
JAY
YO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET,
FEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE
WORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!
WHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing
""The Bird."" During the song, Morris points to--
Jay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's
still in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob,
they nod at each other and--
Jay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage,
and dance us out to the coda, which reads--
CODA
Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3
million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial
failure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly
drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat
boards, and over the course of the next year, while they
waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay
and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out
of them.
CREDITS. THEN--
INT. NOWHERE
A familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW
ASKEWNIVERSE. She puts the book down, smiles at us and skips
off.

Never heard lonely get this quiet
Still, I can't keep from smiling

(Verse One)
Go on tell me what you know about me
That is what i thought
You listen to the talk
But ain’t nobody ever hear me squawk
All of y'all are quick to hate  but y'all gon’ love me when I finally meet the chalk
Watch what I make
Every thing I create
Everything that I touch
I don't need to sling no mud
I don't need a crutch
Ima let the success speak
What the fucks a grudge
Everything you've ever said about me is about to come undone
Acting like i haven't changed
Four passed and you're stuck in the past and you saying that its me to blame
Damn, i moved 500 miles away
Took my life back from the sauce
Reap what you sow and i came to close to being another corpse
Swapped the lines on a dvd case
To bind these lines in a cd case
Traded taps on these bar for these bars on tap
But my drip still finna needa a tray
Ay
Cos I'm either spitting or about to spray
I won't dance around the matter i don't do ballet
If you know me then you know i will say it to your face
Impulsive motherfucker i can't hold it in
Im about to ‘xplode again
Woo
I don't give a fuck about you
Heres front row, enjoy what i do
(Damn what a view)
God damn what a view
So glad so proud - i ain’t one of you
Ima pray straight to the clouds in the pew
The only way to let the demons out it to set the demons loose
If we all sitting ducks tell me who the fucks picking goose
I will
My days are grey
And i take it out on bae
Cos I'm para that she won't stay
Either way I'm pushing her away
When I wanna hold her close
Im so sorry but even in the best of times we don't have the dough so I don't see the need to toast
Far from a chicken but ima give you roast
Cooking up the heat tho I don't like to boast
If a woman’s place in the kitchen ima make my self at home
Kick my feet up while I'm rolling up a cone
Hit it sit back and I'm riding this
Feel this beat n its facts that I body this
Drop to my feet and ill know where nobody is
I drop a tweet everybody got burning ears
As they say if the boots fits thats the furnishing
Right this shit down you would benefit from learning this
Chose not to fuck you over like I didn't know what virgin is
Yet you painted me to be the villain come and tell me to my face what your version is
Im telling you you raped
Every avenue I paved
Everything that i gave
It was all take take take
And I know a yungen that would say the same
We the fam that you claimed
‘Cept when crunch time came
Ego set so big can't except no blame
What a joke ima have to pop another bubble you a no name
Don't take it hard man I'm the same
When its all said and done i just pray
That the life's for everyone around me will change
Have em feeling like this part weren’t a chapter it was just a page
Ay
I write what I’m living
If you don’t like it turn the shit off don’t cross my path
Right now  this is what i’m living
Snakes in the grass
I don’t need a lawnmower to get to killin’
I don’t know whether to make heads or tails i don’t know what i’m feeling
But i’m bouta paint the ceiling with the blood of every single villain
While i reel in just desserts that’s a million
I ain’t trippin’
I ain’t rippin’
Im just flowing like i never took a Ritalin
Yh i know I'm sickening

Said I was okay, but I'm lying, feel like that I'm dying

Stab wounds in my chest, but I'm alright

I love my girl, I hate the thot life
Yellow diamonds, shiny pearls
I'm tryna give her the world
I'm tryna show her the world
She ain't no ordinary girl

Life is a ocean, demons I've been drownin' out

I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail

Mello made it right
I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
Yeah

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side, hate the other side

Bougie off the ecstasy, I might act rude, uh
I lost gang members, I can't act cool, uh
I got gang scriptures in my tattoos
I was runnin' from the police in my trap shoes
Posted, tryna flip a hundred, I couldn't buy food
Come from nothin', but I blossomed to a tycoon
Betrayal scars, can't stop thinkin' 'bout them stab wounds
We might not catch him today but he gon' die soon
I'm from Chicago, she said she like my accent
I'm from Chicago where Glocks what we react with
Standin' tall, make him tumble when that MAC spit
Bitch, I'm a gangster, I just took off on some rap shit (Off on some rap shit)
I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side (Yeah), hate the other side

Hate the other side (Side), hate the other side
Could give a fuck about a bitch, got too much money on my mind
Shit, I heard they was lookin' for me, I'm not hard to find
Everybody that I'm with got nothin' to lose, bitch, they gon' ride (Boom-boom-boom-boom)
Saw my uncle in the grave, that brought tears to my eyes
But I ain't gon lie, I done been through this shit too many times
My heart's still tryna recover from pain all my life
I really been to hell and back a couple hundred times
Couple hundred times, read between the lines
I'm still tryin', I'm still tryin' to get by (Get by)
I still got memories that lay deep inside
Creepin' up on my mind
It's fuckin' up my life

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky

Heart on my sleeve, ball with it like a throwback
Mind in the clouds, I will never ever come back home
We fightin' through a text using all caps
Fuck this, screw that, you sayin' to send you back home
Well, baby girl, I don't want to do that
It's true that you the only home I know
Without you, all it ever does is snow
My voice too deep for a average ho
Babe, welcome to my world, dark and confusin'
Get lost in it often, the same way I'm lost in you
And it's often my mind that I'm losin'
See, half of it's stuck in a pill bottle, high and confused
Don't even know what the fuck I be doin'
Pray every day that I'm far from a nuisance
Tryna figure out how to live with the blueprints

583,4110,Juice WRLD & YoungBoy Never Broke Again,Juice WRLD,Bandit,20,10,"It's funny, the shit I put on this song ain’t gon' sound nothin' like the shit we was just doin’
Oh, yeah
I just want bad bitches
Baddest, them bitches is the baddest, uh, uh
When I take the molly, I'm a savage
Uh, I say, uh

I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh
She the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh, ayy
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh, ayy
But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit

Put the Percs down and picked up the jiggas, jiggas, jiggas
Tommy in the fucking Tommy Hilfiger, ’figer, ’figer
That Tommy hit a nigga, Tommy Hilfiger, fuck niggas
I'm nice, when I’m high off the pills, I'ma fuck with her
I don't smoke skunk, but tonight I'm getting stuck, nigga
Pour the codeine up and put some molly in the cup with it
I know she a freak, uh-huh, she gon’ fuck with it
She my velcro, uh-huh, guess I'm stuck with her
I dive in it like a sailor, I love to nail her
Addicted to her paraphernalia, I had to tell her
I see it like a fortune teller
Your ex-nigga did good, I could do better
Bad bitch from the woods, I think she a hunter
She a killer and an eater, she a Jeffrey Dahmer
I can tell when she in her feelings, I can read her like a book
No TEC, no Beretta, FN on me, am I understood?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh
She the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh, ayy
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh, ayy
But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit

My brother point her out and she a bad bitch, I'm on her
Must ain't heard that I'm a savage, once I get a bitch, I own her
I see she got swag, I got cash so I want her
See this four-five in my pants, put on your ass, push up on bruh
Shawty, she a rider with that glizzy on her (Glizzy on her)
And shawty, I'ma dada with no semi on me (Semi on me)
If we got a problem, we get rid of homie (Yeah)
Put twenty thousand in your pocket, we gon' get the money (Yeah)
I'm the definition of a bandit (Honest)
Took your heart from out his hands and still ain't saying shit (On my mama)
Some new killers in my circle you done ran with
Like this dirty .38, this bitch'll damage
Popping wheelies, 4K Trey, call when you land with it (Pop, pop, pop)
I let you drive and slide with my bros where they be laying with it (Skrrt)
I work this bitch, I open up a can with it
Like fuck the stove, I make it jump without my hand in it
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh
She the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh, ayy
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh, ayy
But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch

Glaub' nicht, dass ich ein Heiliger sein werd'
Aber ich könnte den Fluss runtergehen
Denn die Weise, auf die sich der Himmel öffnet, wenn wir uns berühren
Ja, die bringt mich dazu, zu sagen

Die Art, wie du mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst
Fühlt sich so heilig, heilig, heilig, heilig, heilig an
Auf Gott
Laufe zum Altar wie ein Star-Läufer
Kann keine weitere Sekunde warten
Denn die Art, wie du mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst
Fühlt sich so heilig an

Ich komme nicht gut mit dem Drama klar
Und nein, ich kann nicht ertragen, dass es falsch ist
(Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein)
Ich glaube nicht an Nirvana
Aber die Art, wie wir in der Nacht lieben, gab mir Leben
Baby, ich kann es nicht erklären

Die Art, wie du mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst
Fühlt sich so heilig, heilig, heilig, heilig, heilig an
Auf Gott
Laufe zum Altar wie ein Star-Läufer
Kann keine weitere Sekunde warten
Denn die Art, wie du mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst

Könnte am schwersten zu ertragen sein
Aber wenn du aus dem Wasser kommst
Ich bin ein Gläubiger, mein Herz ist fleischig
Das Leben ist kurz mit einem Temperament wie Joe Pesci
Sie kommen immer und singen dein Lob, dein Name ist eingängig
Aber sie sehen dich nicht so, wie ich dich sehe, Parlay und Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hat die Jet-Geschwindigkeit erreicht
Wenn sie unordentlich werden, gehen sie wie Lionel Messi links
Machen wir einen Ausflug und holen uns die Vespas oder mieten einen Jetski
Ich kenn' die Orte, die das beste Gras haben, wir gehen nächste Woche
Ich möchte dich ehren, ich möchte dich ehren
Der Bräutigam der Braut, ich bin das Kind meines Vaters
Ich weiß, wenn der Sohn die ersten Schritte unternimmt, ist der Vater stolz (Ja)
Wenn du es zum Wasser schaffst, wird er die Wolken teilen (Ah)
Ich weiß, er machte dir einen Snack wie Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Lass es so sein, jetzt musst du es aufräumen (Ooh)
Formalisiere die Vereinigung in Gemeinschaft, er kann vertrauen (Woo)
Ich weiß, dass ich dich nicht verlasse, wie ich weiß, dass er uns nicht verlässt (Ah)
Ich weiß, wir an glauben an Gott, und ich weiß, dass Gott an uns glaubt
Die Art, wie du mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst, mich hältst
Fühlt sich so heilig, heilig, heilig, heilig, heilig an
Auf Gott
Laufe zum Altar wie ein Star-Läufer
Kann keine weitere Sekunde warten, auf Gott

¿Te querrías quedar aquí para siempre, siempre, siempre?
Despertarme solo no es mejor, mejor, mejor
Cada vez que me equivoco tú me corriges
Me corriges como woh-ah, woh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woh-ah-woh, por siempre, siempre, siempre
¿Me quieres mirar para siempre, siempre, siempre?

Sí, ¿me has visto en Las Vegas metido en el Monte Carlo?
Apuesto dinero, bebé, y apuesto que ella no me abandona, oh no
Míralos, viste en el desierto, parece un lago en la arena
¿Mirarías el sol arder junto a mí para siempre, siempre, siempre?
Me sigues intimidando, mantenme con los pies en la tierra
Hazme un hombre mejor, me has hecho
Me has hecho darme cuenta de lo que me estaba perdiendo
Extraño cómo me das una nueva visión del mundo, bebé
Nunca pensé que me estaría tranquilo, no puedo mentirme a mí mismo
Estaba ocupado enfocándome en estar solo
Pon mis sentimientos a un lado, todos se volvieron obsoletos
Los borraste cuando no me quedaba nada

¿Podrías quedarte aquí para siempre, siempre, siempre?
¿Te querrías quedar aquí para siempre, siempre, siempre?
Despertarme solo no es mejor, mejor, mejor
Cada vez que me equivoco tú me corriges
Me corriges como woh-ah-woh, woh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woh-ah-woh, para siempre, siempre, siempre
¿Me quieres mirar para siempre, siempre, siempre?
Cuando me preguntaste si hice trampa, dije: ""Nunca"" (De ninguna manera)
¿Qué estás dispuesta a hacer para permanecer juntos? (Juntos)
¿Cuántas veces vamos a romper antes del verano?
¿Cuántas veces vas a tratar de llamar a mi madre? (Brr-brr)
Chica, me estás matando, no quiero actuar como si pudiera arreglar esto (Arreglarlo, arreglarlo)
No quiero ser el que ha cambiado desde Texas
Es muy natural, pero no puedo comprarlo con tu amor

¿Podrías quedarte aquí para siempre, siempre, siempre?
¿Te querrías quedar aquí para siempre, siempre, siempre?
Despertarme solo no es mejor, mejor, mejor
Cada vez que me equivoco tú me corriges
Me corriges como woh-ah-woh, woh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woh-ah-woh, para siempre, siempre, siempre
¿Me quieres mirar para siempre, siempre, siempre?

Te prometo que te amaré hasta el día de mi muerte
Despierta, tu cara en mi pecho, tu escondite favorito
El techo se ha ido mientras salimos por la puerta privada
Contando las estrellas con nuestro apellido en la placa, woah, oh, oh, oh
Me mentí a mí mismo sobre tratar de estar solo
Cuando me voy, es adiós por ahora, nunca es adiós para siempre
Deja mis sentimientos a un lado, tranquilicemonos
Cada vez que voy por el camino equivocado, me das la vuelta
Me corriges como woh-ah-woh, woh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woh-ah-woh, para siempre, siempre, siempre
¿Me quieres mirar para siempre, siempre, siempre?

(¿Quieres estar aquí conmigo para siempre, siempre siempre?
¿Quieres estar aquí conmigo para siempre, siempre siempre?
Estar solo nunca ha sido bueno, bueno, bueno
Cada vez que voy por el camino equivocado, me das la vuelta)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Genius-traducciones-al-espanol-justin-bieber-forever-ft-post-malone-and-clever-traduccion-al-espanol-lyrics,2020-02-29

597,2599,Justin Moore,Justin Moore,The Ones That Didn't Make It Back Home,16,46,"Tour was up middle of June
She was plannin' a welcome home barbecue
Green bean casserole, grandma's recipe
There was a knock on the door around two o'clock
Two uniforms and her heart stopped
Yellow ribbon 'round an oak tree, blowin' in the breeze

Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home

The whole town shut down, the whole town showed up
Sang Amazing Grace, watched a slide show of
His 22 years, there was laughs and there was tears
And that preacher talked about sacrifice
And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights
Johnny sold beer half priced that night
And everybody raised 'em high singin'
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home

Back to that front porch
Back through that front door
To the life they were fightin' for

Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'

The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

We've come a long way since then, girl
But it's been one hell of a ride

Love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

Girl, there's something kind of dangerous about the way you move
I knew it wouldn't be easy hanging on to you
'Cause when you hit the light, put your lips on mine
It gets hotter than a Houston night
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

You hopped in my Bronco
And we had the time of our life (The time of our life)
We've come a long way since then, girl
But it's been one hell of a ride (One hell of a ride)

Yeah, love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go

Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on

I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry

The first time I slept on the couch, was our first New Year's Eve
I heard words come out my mouth, that I still can't believe
Broken hearts and shattered champagne
We both don't wanna feel that again
The second I apologized, you said, ""Boy, I don't know""
I said it 'cause I meant, but you still wouldn't let it go
So I swallow my pride, see it from your side
I promise I'll do the best I can do

I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you

When you got daughters, always keep 'em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate

Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they're wide awake
Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more livin' for the culture, we nobody's slave

Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own
I pray to God that He'll strengthen my hand
They will think twice steppin' onto my land
I draw the line, it's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain't playin'

Need round two, I need a sequel
Hit the backboard like a free throw
You next level, you a cheat code
In so deep, you hit my seafloor
Got me singing like Alicia
Got me using all your lingo
Tell your girlfriend that you single
Call me over 'cause I go hard
Sweet lil' bih, fuck like a pornstar
Next day, act just like your road dog
Bitches askin' how you know her
Head game stupid, baby loca
Too loud, callate la boca
Out this world, you supernova
Fuck that, I am coming over

Can I come over?
(Can) Can I (I) stop by (Stop by) to see you (See you) tonight?
Can I stop by to see you? (Tonight)

We both on fire, love the teamwork
Leave with juices on your t-shirt
Loud and clear, no need for reverb
Tell the Uber driver revert
Flip that bitch and make a u-turn
Sextape crazy, need the bloopers
Last so long, bae, you a trooper
Sniper gang, no Bradley Cooper
Hi, I'm Hell, it's nice to meet ya
Know you fuckin' with a demon
Do 'bout anything to please ya
Cum inside me, I'm a keeper
Want me to make you a senior?
Never been that hard to read ya
When we done, you say, ""I need ya""
I done made you a believer
Can I come over?

Can I stop by to see you? (Tonight)
Shawty, you know you can always stop by
You top five and no, you're not five
And not four, three, or two, but one, girl
I'm hot now, wanna see what's under
The access easy in a sundress
Your accent's leaking on my tongue, yes
You're badder than the song that's sang from Mike Jack
I made you cum and you came right back
You calling me upon a late night
I got you leaking like a brake pipe
Swimming in your sea, just like a diver
I'm in it, just creeping like a Great White
And I might fuck you in your own car
You ride my face just like a pornstar
I'm in it so deep, just caught a broke jaw
And I just want one thing, that's a phone call

Can I come over? (Can I come over?)

Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort

I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, ""Hit my line""
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'

By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine

And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm

We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
""Pour Some Sugar On Me""
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm

Sells gasoline and what you drink 8 to 3 AM
Got a tattoo for the Corps and ex wife number four
Hummin' along, schoolin' you on the songs on his station
He could be another one cussin' the government, nah, but he smiles
Got hundred reasons not to, but he's the poster child for

Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
Yeah, happy is as happy does

Some find it in the scripture or a Polaroid picture
Or flip a coin, heads, you're goin' to Tucson, Arizona
But it damn sure ain't in the lookin' back on the stuff you never did
Sometimes, you're gonna feel that, but life is better when

Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
'Cause happy is as happy does
She's a long way from the old her
In this mountain dive in Boulder
Every pickle jar, crinkled dollar
Takes her another mile high

Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
When it's all black clouds, find the sun

Fireflies in Tennessee
Sipped a little shine from a paper sack that'll
Knock the horns off a Cadillac
I must've sat on a dozen islands
Watched the sun sink into the sea
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt and hat
But my favorite place to be is

Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

Think I fell in love for the first time
With a girl from Mexico
Thought I found a true love in Malibu, but
That water was a little too cold
Yeah, I left a few tears in the rearview
One or two that were hard to forget
Why you think we call the present the present?
'Cause there ain't no better gift than
Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

A lotta people dreaming 'bout one-day-some-days
Waiting just around the bend (Waiting just around the bend)
I used to be one wonderin' when they'd come
But now I'm livin' in (But now I'm livin' in)
Here and now
Yeah, I'm livin' in the

Red wine made my imagination run

Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang on to anything you can hold

It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

Girl, believe me when I say it's true
Nobody makes me feel the way you do
Well, I love you from the morning 'til the setting sun, yeah
I can taste the ocean on the tip of my tongue
Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang onto anything you can hold

You know 'em by their work name, I know 'em by their birth name
Type of weight make a man stand on principle
Kill yourself but get your whole fam slammed on principle

I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (Lonely)
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (By my lonely)
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (By my lonely)
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie (For real)

Yeah, Speaker Knockerz, I just ordered up, I got a hundred in
Keep the mop, watch how you talk to me, bitch, I'm not one of them
General for real, g-give a decree, the streets salute me
Sweaty sheets, jumpin' up outta my sleep, this how we gotta go eat
Safety pin apiece, cocaine resin stuck on the side of the scale
Watchin' the cameras
If you can deal with the smell, dealin' with paraphernal'
Weight in the pale, keepin' 'em off of the trail
Texture up under my nails
Storm comin', bond money, inevitable that you sit in a cell

I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (Lonely)
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (By my lonely)
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely (By my lonely)
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie (For real)
Sick and tired of my phone ringin', workin' that bitch, I'm takin' a call (Hello)
Workin' with bricks, I'm drivin' a car, (Killer) got my body hard
Big ol' stepper with a rod, shop in the mall, no bodyguard
Heavy metal in my section, I'm controllin', I'm in charge
It's the heavily respected, I'll take a bitch to war
Bitch, I got steppers in my section, bodies on their firearms
Blow the clothes off your back, boom, boom, set off car alarms
C-C-Carbon with a drum, tiger, you no try to run
Give a fuck 'bout your Chanel (I don't)
I'm tied in with the mayor (Achoo)
Go sit down, went to jail
I'm part of the cartel
I'm a Breadwinner don and we came up from nothin'
And we prayed off crumbs, I was raised in the slums

Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright

Don’t save me, I'm in no need of saving (Oh yeah)
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience (Yeah, yeah)
Blood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is (Oh no)

So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that

You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

Underneath the sunrise (Underneath the sunrise)
Show me where your love lies (Tell me where your love lies)
Tell me where your love lies (Show me where your love lies)
Waste the day and spend the night (Yeah, yeah)

Watch  'nother Richard
It's  a million plus three reasons I lied
I couldn't admit it
And I just don't want you to waste my time
'Cause  I'm tryna get with ya
I  be feelin' down but I'm fine when I'm with ya
You be thinkin' I be lyin' when I say I miss you
Girl,  you know I'm on your body, on your body like a tissue
They be callin' you Illuminati when I'm with you (Illuminati when I'm with you)
I say, ""Maybe, it's your third eye,"" I love your mental (Third eye, I love your mental)
VVS's on me look like Now and Laters, lick you up
I  bet you never go back to the guy that was with you (Guy that was with you)
She got every pair of Chanel out of SoHo
Tribeca, hit the city to show off
And when you get dressed up, you take hours
Baby girl, you know you can do whatever, you got...

Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I've been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place, mmh, nah
It's crowded
In LA, but I'll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you're down, I could show you around if you're really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it's cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we've been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (No no, no, oh yeah)

Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Khalid-right-back-remix-lyrics,2019-04-20

Ain't much change in me, y'all (Yeah)
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all
Thank God I saw another day (Uh-huh)

Yeah, baby, there he go, yeah, really, really (Oh)
Won't be out there lookin' crazy, hazy, ho (Hello)
And it's like I surf the waves forming in my dome
We keep floatin', hopin', coastin'
Ragin' through the day, sexy baby, turn me on-on (Uh)
Hear me out, hear me, hear me
Come on, ready or not, nigga comin' with it
Come on with the team, hear me, hear me
Oh no, hit 'em up and I'm rippin', rippin', isn't he? (Yeah)
And I'm comin' full-blown to the tombstone (Yeah)
How I'm livin', gotta push it, gotta set the tone (Yeah)
It ain't nothin' to me, baby, say I'm livin' wrong (Livin' wrong)

And I'm tellin' baby, ""Don't try, this is a trip that I gotta do alone,"" mm
Here we are, no shit, tell the boys we get ripped, rage on
This the cops worst problem, hanging all out my whip, yee-haw
This the bond with my fam, this is all of our fix, days long
Can't stop a nigga, no, bitch, nah
King Wizard, nah, you ain't hip, yeah (Yeah)
Hear they tryna stop me, hate on my growth (Yeah)

But I'm on a high pеak level (Yes), Rolliе with no ice in the bezel, clean (Yeah)

Serving heat up meaner than your team's is out the gate (Yeah)

Boom-boom, you can't overlook him, 'bout to go postal, tell me who relate
And then I'm lost in the freeway, buck ten, thinking 'bout the life I made, hey, hey (Ah)
Doomed since I left the womb, where I run to?
And it's like I'm in a battle, leakin' from a wound (Yeah)
Praise God, thank you, never left me on my own (No)
Shades locked over my eyes, my disguise is on (Gone)
Damn, he found it, that pure bliss, I'm wildin' (Wildin')
Tryna stay grounded, keep my niggas around me (Yeah)
Sometimes on my dolo
While I pull up a smooth toke, lift up pronto
I'm rubbin' on her body
With my eyes on the road, them toes, this hotty (Yeah)
We off, we slide, we ain't scared to die (Let's go)
Speak less, more sex, yeah, we goin' live (Nigga)
Yeah, I figured that I'm empty, but I'm on a rise (Yeah)
Take it slow, hell no, aiming for the light (Woo)

Be who you are, don't be nothin' less, please
Hear me, Lord, don't ever leave, see
I'm a man in the night in these dark streets

New attitude mixed with that pure raw (Aw)

She like, ""Do me, baby, down to get busy, busy?"" (Yes)
No dice, chill, whoadie (No)
In life, feeling dizzy
Oh, having visions of the city and I go to war
See me in the day through the late night (Night)
Tell 'em it's the charm, I'm in freeze mode
To the gods, can't stop a hero when he in flight (Flight)
I'm swimming in the light right
Go and get you some, go and show 'em something, this a new thang
Yeah, I let my nuts hang (Yeah)
Knock your top off with LeBron or Dwyane Wade (Yeah)

Can't stunt a nigga growth, better get gone, move along (Uh)

You don't wanna act, don't get me wrong (Nah)

We ain't gotta tell 'em, we just getting ready (Yeah)
See 'em fronting, we ain't kidding
If you want it, you can get it
Members of the rage, come and get you some
Next step's out the jet from the lean back
Running 'round the world and we ain't packed
Hit 'em, vroom, vroom, leave 'em stuck, oh, you seen that?
I'm chillin' where the team at
See a black Benz pull up with some jawns, yeah, I need that
So crazy, can't believe it
No cams, damn, no filming at all, real nigga facts (Come on)
Years ago, rehab
All good, helped me figure out another plan
It got bad, so bad

Half of us walking around like a zombie apocalypse
Other half are just pissed off and (Yeah)
Don't wanna wear a mask and they're just scoffing
And that's how you end up catching the shit off 'em
I just used the same basket as you shopping
Now I'm in a fuckin' casket from you coughin' (Damn)
Always stay ahead of haters, let 'em hate
But never let a traitor penetrate your circle
Separate yourself from those who try to pull you down
The real ones never stray, it's sort of like Medusa (Yeah)
That's how you stay ahead of snakes (Woo)
Emcees pull out gats, I don't give a fuck how strapped
You're gonna out-rap me? I doubt that
Please, bitch, I'm a house rat
These raps are 'bout that cheese like mousetraps
Earthlings, I adapt to 'em
Certain things, I don't want to do, but have to in
Order to just act human
Like using a bathroom and vacuuming (Yeah)
Rapping in the booth in a triple fat goose hazmat suit
Bubble wrap and a mask too and
I don't think that's what they meant by trap music (Nah)
Running through ink like I'm tattooing (Yeah)
This is music to be murdered by, you love
Turn the volume up, I am fired up like a blunt
Bread is long like an Italian sub, I am drugs
That is probably why your opinion of me's high as fuck
And it's nonstop fury (Yeah)
'Cause I ain't holding 'em up like an armed robbery (Nah)
And God's my jury, so when I die, I'm not worried (Nah)
Prayers to George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery (Yeah)
How the fuck is it that so many cops are dirty? (Huh?)
Stop, man, please, officer, I'm sorry
But I can't breathe when I got you on top of me
Your goddamn knee's on my carotid artery (Fuck)

It's gettin' dark, my Glock on my lap, I'm just thinkin' smart
So she hop out, she switchin' and shit, this bitch thick as shit
She got two minutes, if she ain't back out, then she gon' need a Lyft
She left her phone, so I picked it up, this ho slow as fuck
Nine missed calls, three of 'em from Mom, the other six say Duck
Now I look up and I see a truck, it's just pullin' up
Someone hopped out, a big goofy nigga, he tryna look tough
I'm like, ""What? What he tryna do?"" So I clutched my move
But he kept walkin', he don't want no smoke, boy, he not bulletproof
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O

She walk out, she stop in her tracks, she get to steppin' back
Then I hear smack, this big goofy nigga, he pullin' her tracks
I wanna help, but this ain't my ho, you know how it go
Don't got no cape, I still got her phone, she takin' too long
She get loose, she run to my car, so I hit the locks
Tossed her her phone, told shorty I'm gone, bitch, you on your own
But here come goofy, he hollerin' and shit, yellin' 'bout a bitch
Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip
Now I'm like, ""Shit,"" I hopped out so quick, then I raised my blick
And I don't miss, I let off two shots, I hit him in his shit
Now, Von, think quick, what you finna do? 'Cause this gon' make the news
Gotta make your move, told that bitch, ""Get in,"" 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, ""No doubt""
""I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb""
She started laughin', she say, ""Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd""
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee

I'ma let this MAC fly with this, hold on
I said I'ma let that⁠—
Alright, come on (Von), alright (Von)

Got a drop on this flexin' nigga, he from Tennessee
I had a thot, she be with the shits, she told me where he be
I say for sure, baby let me know if you wanna eat
She like ""Von, you already know, just put put your girl on fleek""
I'm like ""Cool, I can do that, boo, what you want some shoes?
""Jimmy Choo, with a handbag too, red or baby blue?""
She get to smiling, she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit
I'm just laughing, could've been a pimp the way I move my lips
I be speeding, could've been a driver the way I push the whip
You a ho, could've been a bitch the way you throw a fit
But fuck that, right back to the script 'cause this a major lick
He got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist
Now it's like six, told her hit his phone
Meet her in The Wic, but he ain't go
But he ain't that slow, said meet him at the store
I'm like cool, let him front his move, do what he gon' do
'Cause this the plot, put him in a pot, let it cook like stew
I grab my Glock, it been through a lot but it still shoot like new
We at the top, yeah we lost a lot, but that's just how it go
But check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6 to 24
Let me focus, can't be zoning out, he pulling up now
He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fork
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
The block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happened:
I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lackin', 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out ""What's crackin?""
I'm like, ""What?"", I'm like, ""Nigga, who?"", I was born to shoot
I got aim, I'm like Johnny Dang, when it comes to chains
So I ride, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh
This no lie, bitch it's do or die, you say you gon' slide?
You got some nerve, yo' shit on the curb, boy we put in work
From 64th, and from 65th, we not from 63rd
I got a drop on a rappin' nigga, I be from the 'Raq
I'm like, cool, better not front yo' move, or you become a pack
You see Von, you see 40 Glocks, see Booka, you see MAC
Yeah free Mak, gone for a double homi', foenem got yo back
But fuck that, say you smoking who? Quickest way to die
Snatch who chain? Off who neck? Not mine
Ain't no point in trying
They not out, plus the police hot, ain't no point in sliding
They be talking from the internet, they don't be outside
Hit the six, call DaDa out, tell him 'bout a lick
We need tape, we need rope and phones, don't forget the blicks
He like, ""Cool, how that nigga look?"" I pull up some flicks
He like, ""Damn I think I know the nigga"" He cool with his bitch
We at V-Live, but we went to Structure, but we played a lot
Got a goofy walking in and out, telling me his car
He in a Cat, bet, I'ma pay you half, just finesse
I'm 300, clips don't come like that, three drums to his chest
Boom, boom, boom (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down

So baby let me look at you and see just what I got
If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot
And if I could inhale you, oh baby I'd be gone
I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long

You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip

Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

Not everybody's first word sounds the same
But we all get born and we all get raised
Whether it's some boondocks or Marina Del Rey
Everybody turns wild when you're 16
Slow roll, big timin' on Main Street
Everybody's got holes in their blue jeans
If you bought 'em that way or not

Turn it up and sing along
We all work 'til the daylight's gone
We all knock off the edge around five
Fall in love from a kiss on Friday night
And we've all had a broken heart
We've all closed down a few good bars
Take a look around, y'all, tell me I'm wrong
Ain't the whole wide world just one big country song?
Just one big country song

Yeah, well who gon' try to find some water when it's hot? (When it's hot)
Whether it's a pontoon, tube or a yacht (Yeah)
Who ain't got a dog that they love like a brother? (I do)
And who ain't ever tasted better cookin' than their mother?
Who ain't got a story to tell?
And who ain't made it through some hell?
Who don't love somebody, don't miss somebody?

When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know

Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity

You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory

You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

Oh, I believe
Yes, I believe

Made him ice out my neck and the wrist too
Hold down your pussy and your pistol (Let him know, girl)

They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather

This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

I be at James Harden house, I'm all in Houston in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York, I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players
I just wan' show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
I might just stand up and go crazy, someone make the layup
And we ain't squashin' shit for free, you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up, yeah
Know he might not beat it, I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas, y'all got women tendencies
I don't gotta sell drugs no more, I'm bossed up, I got plenty business
Ridin' 'round in that Lam' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city

All I ever want was to put on and give my folks somethin'

Mama trippin' 'bout the way I'm livin' and how my hoes comin' (In and out)
Caught the next-door neighbor slippin', we slimed him, left his nose runnin' (In his house)
Knowin' I can't lie, so when she asked me, I  make no comment
Terrorizin', thuggin', doin' dumb shit, makin' no money
It was time for me to go up, got a pack and made it blow up
Went into that corner store until I got it all
Know I skipped a couple parts, but I can't never tell 'em all
But the moral of the story, I got it all out the mud
The way karma make me feel, I swear I think I'm in love
Been fuckin' strippers since I was lil', fell in love with the club
Bruh gave me everything I need, knew what to say to the plug
I got my hands on a few mil', but shit, it still ain't enough
It's like my life is like a dream, but I'm still here when I wake
I'm gon' get everything I need, I'll do whatever it take
I caught a case, ran, got away, I should've jumped in the lake
I thought about it the other day when I slid through in the Wraith
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain

She proud to be rockin' that new two-tone

I'm livin' my best just like Lil Duval
I didn't get the message, and it's screw y'all
I don't want no issues, can't be beefin' with my family
I don't want no problems, just make sure my kids can count and read
And it ain't no pressure 'bout the money, I won't even see it
It's bigger, it's the principle, I hope one day that you can see
We got a whole seed to raise, it's bigger than you and me
How I'm not gon' do that? I spend millions on my jewelry
The only reason I'm mentionin' it is 'cause I'm tired of this foolery
I'm just emptying my thoughts, I can't keep 'em in a box
Ain't no hard feelings at all, I want everyone to ball

Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)

I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news

(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Firin' at everybody

I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him

I used to pray for a plug who gon' go out the way
And come back with a lot of them bitches
I used to dream about condos when we leavin' Lenox
Now I stay on top of them bitches
I wouldn't give a damn if he ran him up a whole billion
I still wouldn't acknowledge the nigga
He put my name in a song, what the fuck is he on?
I don't care, boy, we gotta go get him
House big as fuck in the middle of nowhere
I dick her down, I don't care what my ho wear
I made Lil' Cam spin the block on a four-wheel
Nah, for real, spin the block on a four-wheel
Five million dollars, for me, that ain't no deal
I done made that times six in like three years
Off this rap shit, I can't even talk about this trap shit
I just hope they can take it, I keep me a stallion like Megan
A residency out in Vegas
Might fly to L.A. and go fuck with LeBron and the Lakers
Come back to Atlanta with Jayda
Bruh told us to take care of the neighbors and stack all the paper
Whatever we want, buy it later
I know how to shit on a hater and handle the business
Whatever God give me, I'm grateful
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody

Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him

Cartier watches for everyone 'round me
I ran it up, how the fuck could you down me?
She set for life, how the fuck could you clown her?
Bought all this water, I'm never gon' drown
I'm in the 'yo, I'm perfectin' my sound
I helped 'em out and they let me down again
I ain't comin' back around again
Fell in love and I found a friend
I done geared up the motor
My brother in prison in Polo
I jumped in the game and went loco
I put on these clothes like a hobo
That's layers of drip
I showed my ass in Phipps
You play, ya mans get killed
Said that before, but I'm dead for real
Lil' bro jumpin' 'round like his leg done healed
I ran it up off of vacuum seal
If I fall off today, I'm a legend still
Bro showed me the way, I ain't never steal
This Glock ain't no prop, it'll pop for real
I fuck with that syrup, I don't pop no pills
My young niggas turnt, they don't got no deals
I need me a billion so I can chill
I'm drivin' like I ain't got no license still
My Trackhawk move like it got nitrogen, I'm poppin' seals
I'm firin' at everybody

Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him

I paid attention and found out the recipe
I take a seat and they still won't get 'head of me
I'm on my shit, now a bitch can't get next to me
You ain't got a hundred thou', you can't have sex with me
Ain't showed the best of me yet
And ain't in nobody debt, I'm somethin' like a vet
I bought my big brother a 'Vette
My numbers so good, my label probably owe me a check
They play with Lil Baby, I swear it's gon' go down
The biggest lil' nigga that's over at Motown
Jumped off the porch and went straight kicked the door down
Flip the clip, switch the clip, then some more rounds
Rappers fake and be hatin', I don't go 'round
I took 12 on a chase, I had four ounces
Ask around, we them guys, I do no clownin'
If I can, I'ma try keep the smoke down
Once it's up, then it's stuck, it can't go down
Like to switch where I sleep, I got four houses
Every time the heat come, I make four thousand
Big done gave me the game and I ran with it
Milk the game 'til I quit, I ain't playin' with it
Could've been hit your bitch, I be sparin' niggas
Make me mad, I'ma call up them grave diggers
Bought my mom a new crib, and it's way bigger
Never been to it once, that's a great feelin'
I'ma go there when I get a chance
I lost five hundred racks before I signed a deal
Swear to God, I still got my advance
Yeah, I'm lit, I been savin' this guala up
Yeah, I hit, but she didn't get a follow-up
Ain't no reason to beef with no one about none of these women
I promise they swallow us all

Sippin' syrup 'til my body numb, I ain't tryna catch no feelings
I ain't never bite no nigga
She give me brain now 'cause I'm famous
I got these chains on, gettin' tangled
I'm in the big Benz, not a Wrangler
It's still a Jeep though, it ain't cheap, ho
I'm just happy they gon' free Rico
Dodgin' stank hoes and R.I.C.O.
On a Sprinter van with them Dracos
Probably ridin' around with Starlito
I'ma bust it down with my lil' bros
Buy cars for all of my kinfolk
If the sack ever did get low

Treat me with gratitude, I ain't no average dude
Need my rims offset like Cardi B
This might be my hardest beat
Put the blame on Pee, he started me
Got the game from Big, he guarded me
Coach threw me in, took me out the streets
Now I get racks to rap on beats
I still know plugs with packs for cheap
Killers owe favors, they'll whack for free
Never did fraud, I got cash receipts
Lotta niggas get they swag from me
Don't tell nobody 'bout bags from me
You were not in the street, you wouldn't last a week
My bitch so bad, I pass on freaks
I'm here 'cause my granny be prayin' for me

Had to make myself a boss, it ain't no nigga workin' me
I invest a couple mil' and let my money work for me
Know they hate the way it happened, probably somewhere cursin' me
I don’t know nothing ’bout no killin', all I know is murder beats
I got rich and understand my next three cars gon’ be a lease
I ain't never losin' sleep about no beef, I roll in peace
I put diamonds in my teeth, came from grindin' in the streets
Get a load and break it down and sell it all and then repeat it
Pray to God for all the dawgs behind the wall, they need they freedom (Free y’all)

Wonderin' did she mean it when she say she hate me?
Or wonderin' did she mean it when she say she wished she didn't keep the baby? (Down on my luck and up against the wind)

Told Solid to speed it up, you ain't driving Miss Daisy
Rolls Royce truck plus, yeah, you driving Lil Baby
Hit from the back and grab her neck, it be drivin' her crazy
Ain't work no job since we met, I'm the reason she lazy
I got some checks that I ain't touch, they for Loyal and Jason
Really wanna have a daughter just so I can spoil her
Maybe look at women different
Father God, forgive me, I'ma been sinning for a minute
We bought sticks when it was tension
Fuck that bitch, she want attention
She get famous if I mention
I ain't gon' say her name at all
I was just sittin' in prison, damn near livin' like a dog
I remember that shit vividly, I do this shit for y'all
I'm not lookin' for no sympathy, won't cry about no loss
I got demons all on my back and arms, I'm tryna shake 'em off
I can't never fuck with lil' Mill again, he tried to take me off
I can't lie, you was my dawg, I heard that shit, it broke my heart
Can't no nigga say I did somethin' flawed, been solid from the start
Every situation ever happened, Baby played his part
I ain't never did shit to brag about it, I do that shit with honors
In my bag, but I been layin' back, I'm turnin' up this summer
Guess you mad 'cause I've been havin', tellin' hoes I was a runner
If I was, I was the richest runner in Georgia, on my mama
And I ain't never been no worker, had my own number, ask bruh
Seven summers straight we went crazy, called it good luck
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble

I know that my heart is black, so all my cars' insides is red
I don't wanna argue with no one, let's get this guap instead
I ain't tryna beef with none these niggas 'cause all my opps is dead
If you ever run into police, you better not tell
Turn it up, I might as well, you know I'm so 4PF
'Fore I go, I gotta say what's up to all the bros in jail
I know that they be listenin', I know that he'll be with me
And his lawyer cost one-sixty, I hope they un-convict him when he go back
Follow him with a low jack, then step on him like a doormat

I told her to fly and she scared of the virus, I sent her a private to get here
I made four hundred dollars off of each of these pounds, I ain't trippin', it's gon' be a good year
Solomon drivin' while I got my hands on the chopper, I'm keepin' my eyes in the rearview
I'm from Atlanta where they pay to triple cross niggas, they'll dap you up, then they'll kill you
These niggas fake and I'm real, I don't feel 'em
My niggas takers, ain't worried 'bout 'em stealing
I run with apes and some baby gorillas
I know a few (Shh), I can buy me a nigga
Said I wouldn't change but my change a lil' bigger
Four-carat ring leave a scar if I hit you
Look like a spaceship, got stars in my vehicle
These niggas fake and I don't wanna deal with 'em all

I'm social distancing
Man, these niggas can't touch me, I can't get sick
Good excuse for me to pour up medicine (Syrup)
She say I ain't got no heart and I'm devil-sent
I'm on some savage shit, ah
I got the drop on the opps, switched the cars
I got a hundred inside of a drum
We pull up clapping, a round of applause
We just gon' say that they won the award
Slide in the daytime, then come back at night
We gon' make sure that nobody play with us
They make me mad, I'ma turn up
Let's talk about money, I swear I been savin' up
I'm really sick with this shit, got 'em throwin' up
He hit a lick for a brick, now he goin' up
My niggas rapping, you see us, we blowin' up
Hit the bitch for a rack, then ignore her
I'm so sick of these rats and these whores
I might marry my girl and just go away
Eat her out if she rich, got expensive taste
We ain't got rush, told the pilot to fuckin' wait
Ain't no way I can go on no fuckin' date
I don't know her and she don't know me
My lil' boy 'dem turnt up at a young age
You can say that it run in my genes

I'm social distancing

Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million-dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately, I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time they gon' try to come take it

Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me

Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be

Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee

712,7702,Lil Baby,Lil Baby,The Bigger Picture,20,3,"Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight

You know how I'm coming

Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
""Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses""
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect

Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)

I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless
If you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent
Drive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)

I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid

Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor

We don't sell shit, we just make hits, yeah
Turn up

Keepin' my composure, never sober
Never chokin', always smokin doja
Fuck 'em if they gettin' over
Got a Moncler coat because the kid the coldest
I ain't changed, I stayed the same and maintained
It's safe to say the kid gettin' older
Forever gang, I'm never switchin' over
Made a lane and niggas can't get over
I can't match with rappers, they be bogus
Really get a pack and keep the over
Big dripper, stand up in the ocean
Everybody trappin', we get loads in
He ain't 4PF if he ain't got motion
Made a half a ticket off promotion
Shout out Swishers Sweet, they keep me rollin'
But if we catch the opp, we gotta smoke him
Ridin' 'round with Dracs like we OVO
I got some racks and I want some more
Still got them passin' the hood, call it give-and-go
Keep a nigga main bitch in a figure-four
Let me fuck when I want, I just come and go
Man, these racks gettin' too big for these skinny clothes
I might put me an M in some big Girbaud
Let lil' bro hit the stick, had start gettin' old
I spent five hundred racks on a Lambo'
And didn't even know how to make that motherfucker go
On my birthday, I just wanna lift the door
Barely flex, but don't play with me, period
Shooters follow behind in a Urus
In the Rolls truck, I feel like a tourist
I'm the one from the bottom who sold all my partners them pounds
Used to drive in a Buick
Hot, hot, hot, I'm heatin' up
I fuck with slimes and I'm gonna bust (Bah, bah)
He can't put on that drip, he ain't one of us
How you ridin' in a Benz and a Tonka truck?
How you got everybody lit, pipin' up?
Oh, she bad with no swag, I can pipe her up

Count the money up fast like I'm typin' somethin'
I'm the type to get active and never run (Wunna)

Keep the Rugers, my niggas ain't scared of nothin' (Nah)
And ain't no rules, you got racks, you can get it done (Yeah)
On a light day, I keep me a honey bun (One hundred)
Makin' hit after hit, call me Barry Bonds (Hits)
For this Christmas, I bought everybody guns (Swear)
Glocks and choppers and FN's for everyone (Grrat)
Take that roof off the car, let her feel the sun (Wow)
My bro go see his barber five times a month (Yeah)
Got this bitch out the college, she suckin' and swallow (Uh)
I stick it in, she feel it in her gut (In her gut)
We don't run from our problems, we stackin' up guala and guala I'm tryna get that mega bucks (Racks)
We them drippers, lil' nigga, best watch your step (Them drippers)
This top shelf, got forty designer belts (Drip)
4PF look like the new BMF
Think I'm deaf, got stones in my right and left (Ice)
How you crank up the car? Ain't no key in there
Just pull up, spin they block, and get out of there (Get out of there)
Wake up, have a hard time findin' what to wear
Treat these hoes like a tire, I keep a spare
Want a strap because I'm war ready (War)
Check the trust account, it's more fetti (Yeah)

Hundred-fifty plain Richard Millie (No cap)
I'ma milk the game until it's empty

Thought I'd be trappin' forever, but God came and blessed me
I guess it was part of the plan
How he on fire, but he cool as a fan?
Can't get at you, we gon' get at your man
They can relate to me 'cause I be poppin' it
Put in they face, let 'em see what I'm sayin'
I'm rockin' shows like I play with a band
Free all the bros, know I would if I can
If I don't mean it, I swear I ain't sayin' it
'Fore I was 21, swear I was savage, smashin'
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

We got FN with extensions, we throwin' that
Her ass got my full attention, she throwin' that
Niggas talkin' way too much, I ain't goin' back
And forth with niggas 'cause these niggas be holdin' racks
On the real, yeah, we know you don't own them racks
Four pockets full, push 'em down, they start pokin' back
I turned eight million right until I'm a quarterback
Spent a million like I'm tryna bring Kobe back (24, woo)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I use the crockpot like it's Betty
They say the drop hot and it's ready
Might stretch it out, but it ain't fetti (Yes)
Say my dawg doin' time
But I know he ain't gonna snitch 'cause it's still some shit he didn't tell me
My dawg stabbed his celly
He told me the whole story over the celly (Brr, hello?)
Went up on my price, in my pocket like Kelly
Fucked her in the telly, no I can't not say who, no telly
My head gettin' heavy
And you know I still got Balmains on my ass (Woo)
No, I can't do no Amiris
Said I'm takin' trips, long flights, they scary
She said her birthday in March, okay, cool, so that means you an Aries
I told her, ""Gotta go,"" she said, ""You serious?""
Diamonds cold as December, my vibe Sagittarius
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up (Haha, period, period, slatt, woo)
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

I can switch up and come back another way
If the vibe ain't right, come back another day
Biggest dripper, I start up a tidal wave
Remix weed, we put it in a microwave
Batch for twenty-three like I know Michael J
He can say what he want, but he gotta pay
Used to hide all the guns where my mama stay
Sell my drugs 'round the corner
I pay all these bills, I'm a grownup
My cars a lil' different, I own 'em
I ain't with no leasin', my bitch tellin' me I need credit
It's loud and clear if I said it
I come from the gutter, I spent me a hundred on Chevys
You can take me out the hood, but you can't take the hood out of me
Know the hood proud of me
I Givenchyed my tee, went and upgrade my teeth
Yeah, I dropped out of school, but that paper on me
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Lil-baby-commercial-lyrics,2020-03-14

Twysted Genius, baby

If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (Gimme that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step out, she be flashin'
Whenever we get alone, I give her half and she get nasty
My jeans is special edition, Amiri send me these pants
And now everybody be tough, is he gangster or he just actin'?
Ain't got no card, don't do no fraud, seem like all of my bitches plastic
Know you niggas don't want smoke, let's see who run it up the fastest
Keep that fire when I'm cold, I can't let them catch me lackin'
I don't know if they think I'm sweet because I'm rappin'
But fuck 'em, we get active (Get active)

Wrap it, make sure they can't smell it
Drive too far? Don't matter, I'll mail it
Tryna steal swag, I see it, I smell it
Used to get mad, probably beat up my celly
Now I sell bags every day in my city
Ain't doin' no playin', when they come, be ready
I got murder on my mind like that lil' nigga Melly (Free Melly)
Big boy rocks, stud the same size as Nelly (Ten karats)
Long as I live, I'ma get this cheddar
Ever since the bitch left, doin' lil' better
Which car I'ma drive? It depends on the weather
Rolls Royce truck pull up like, ""Hello""
Pretty, tall, light skin, shake like Jell-O
If the bitch actin' bougie, I'ma take her to the ghetto
If I ain't smokin' Runtz, then it's probably Limoncello
You got a lil' boy, but you not on my level
Sell P's every day in the hood on my schedule
Young nigga give a ho whole groove like Stella
Jam don't shake like that, that's Jell-O
Made a whole M on the road, then lay low
I'm a real boss in my hood, I got say-so
I was havin' choppas 'fore I heard about Dracos
Put me in the casket with a bust down halo, yeah
If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (Give me that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step by, she be flashin'

I don't know if they think I'm sweet because I'm rappin'
But fuck 'em, we get active

Suavé (Huh), sippin' promethazine latte (Yeah)
Sticky-ass weed like Scotch tape (Yeah)
Big B's, call me Banye (Hoo)
Me and Lil Baby compadre (Yeah)
What these niggas talkin' 'bout? Blasé (Huh)
Diamonds on me, that's pavé (Huh)
So bright, can't see, that's a blind date (Huh)
Marley and Fee trynna get high weight (Ooh)
I got M-O-L-L-Y weight
Only once the drugs are done
I feel like, ""Where the hell is my grave?""
Heartbeat beatin' at a high rate
World stop spinnin', start to vibrate
It's a cold world, so my house in Miami still came with a fireplace
Pupils dilate, don't judge me
I'm with a sex slave, she like rough D
I got a text straight from the plug, he said ""There's a drought""
I said ""Funny"", now we laughin'
And only time that we act, is when we act asses
Nigga, we active
So if you 'bout that life, get out that casket
If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (Ooh, give me that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together (Yeah, yeah)
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step by, she be flashin'

It's your boy, just one of the guys down here
Well, I could be more specific
Uh, I'm a human
And I just wanted to, you know
For the sake of all of us earthlings out there
Just wanted to say:

We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home

Hi, I'm a baboon
I'm like a man, just less advanced
And my anus is huge

Hey, I'm a zebra
No one knows what I do, but I look pretty cool
Am I white or black?

I'm a lion cub
And I'm always getting licked (Meow)
How's it going? I'm a cow (Moo)
You drink milk from my tits (Moo)

I'm a fat, fuckin' pig

I'm a common fungus

I'm a disgruntled skunk, shoot you out my butthole

I'm a marijuana plant, I can get you fucked up

And I'm Kanye West

We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth
Ba-dum-ba-dum-dum, ba-dum-da-di
We are the vultures, feed on the dead

We're just some rhinos, horny as heck

I'm just a giraffe, what's with this neck?

Hippity-hop, I'm a kangaroo
I hop all day, up and down with you

I'm an elephant, I got junk in my trunk

What the fuck? I'm a clam!

I'm a wolf. Howl!

I'm a squirrel, lookin' for my next nut
And I'm a pony, just a freak horse, heh-heh-heh
But, uh, c'mon, get on (Get on), yah!
Giddy up, let's ride

I'm HPV, don't let me in

I'm a koala and I sleep all the time
So what? It's cute

We love you, India

We love you, Africa

We love the Chinese

We forgive you, Germany

Earth, it is our planet (It's our planet)
We love the Earth (We love the Earth), it is our home (Home)
We love the Earth, it is our planet (It is our planet)
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth

I'm a man (Hello?)
Can you hear me? (Anyone out there? Hello?)
I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit (What's going on?)
I hope it's not a simulation (Huh)
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick (Woo), eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill (Hey), respect what we built (Hey)
Like look at the internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love to cum when you have sex? (Ayy)
And I heard women orgasms are better than a dick's (Uh)
So what we got this land for? What we gotta stand for?
Love, and we love the Earth (The Earth)

Oh, yeah, baby, I love the Earth
I love this planet

Hey, Russia, we're cool
Hey, Asia, all of you, c'mon
Every one of you from the plains to the Sahara
Let's come together and live

Hum-dum-dum-dae-dum, hum-dum-dum-dae-dum

우-우-우리는 지구를 사랑해요

Amamos la tierra

我们爱地球

(We love you, we love you)
C'mon everybody, I know we're not all the same
But we're living on the same Earth
(We love you, we love you)
Have you ever been to Earth?
Everyone who is listening has been to Earth, Ariana
(We love you, we love you)
We're not making music for aliens here
Are we gonna die?
You know what, Bieber? We might die
(We love you, we love you)
I'm not going to lie to you
I mean, there's so many people out here who don't think global warming's a real thing. You know? We gotta save this planet. We're being stupid

(Turn Me Up Josh)
Whoa, oh, oh

Them niggas act like they don't need us
They do everything we doing they wanna be us
Foenem takin' ecstasy, they tryna T up
He rather go and blow a bag instead of re-up
You wasn’t on that block when that shit was goin' on
I wasn't worried about the other side when that shit was goin' on
And we don't hang with different niggas, don't ask us what we on
The only time we'll beat the case, you pull out camera phones
I used to draw Lil' Mo name on the styrofoam
I had to teach the grown niggas, right from wrong
Why the state had told the jury, ""They tryna indict us all""
The lawyers got them affidavits, they better sign them all, hm
I had a bad bitch off the 'Gram, she let her titties hang
She told Bandz I bought her a Birkin, I told her anything
I was ridin' 'round with guns in that Bentley thang
We puttin' stickers on our drums, that's a city thang
I hate the niggas who be tryna switch the block up
I be with the killers who would change a nigga roster
I'm from the part of the city, watch your partner
You ain't did shit to the same nigga who shot ya
'Fore you leave that door, gotta pick your Glock up
Can't nut in no more whores, I got that from my momma
Shuttin' down the stores, you do that with these commas
You had me at my lowest, I'm ridin' 'round with choppers
(Oh)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked out by my homie (No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know that shit's phony (No, no, no, no, no, whoa)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (Oh)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know this love phony

That's a bet
I'm The Voice, that mean Dee-Dee, he the threat
Don't get stretched, 'cause foenem tweakin' off the X
I know what happened to your homie, don't be next
He got that get back for his block, I tilt my hat
I feel like I'm drownin', got this water 'round my neck
Cocky nigga throwin' ashes on Pateks
Went to the trench store, threw up the treys on the mat (Yeah)
They be callin' me, you hangin' with dangerous
I'm just slidin' 'til out west, just for Uncle Remus
All my sibling's kids know your uncle famous
I know this shit sound dumb and the strangest
In the trenches, I feel the safest
On the radio, shoutout Nehpets
Did it off the love but I gave ‘em faces

(Oh)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know that shit's phony (No, no, no, no, no, whoa)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (Oh)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know this love phony
(Oh)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked out by my homie (No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)

I pour an eight inside the Lam' truck, fell asleep flyin'
I thought them niggas had my back, but I'm steady seein' signs
And I can't turn my back on Boona like I ain't see him tryin'
These tears shed, whenever he dead, it's different seein' him die
Bah, get close up on 'em, you know that shit be graphic
You gotta pop out with that ratchet, you know this shit get tragic
And you can't fumble with that stick, you know this shit ain't Madden
All that shit you did in the streets, you know that shit gon' vanish
Yeah, I pop these pills, they try to read my thoughts
And you can't dig back in your past 'cause you got time you lost
And make that time up for your kids 'cause you know time ain't bought
Booka bought me a diamond cross, but he know he won't cross me
They turned they back and said they'd kill me, yeah, that's when they lost me
I put baguettie inside the Cartier 'cause I'm feelin' bossy
They feel some type of way in the county jail, I told 'em call me
I built a relationship with the real with niggas who never saw me
Yeah, I seen my chance and that's when I grabbed it
Fuck bein' a hundred, I spent a couple hundred on niggas' tablets
Lean gave me chest pains, that's when I popped the Perky tablet
I tried to get that family vibe for niggas who wasn't established
You do that shit again, what you did to bro gon' get you a casket
I did shit for niggas without them askin'
I broke pounds for niggas without them matchin'
I don't fuck with you, I'ma tell y'all nah even though I got it
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This shit was different, we was together like ten years ago
And I don't talk to a lotta niggas, but they still the bros
The ones I ain't talk to like that back then, know they still hoes
And some niggas try to hide they hate, but that shit still show
I never fucked on block hoes because I call 'em sisters
One hate me right now as I speak because I called her a hooker
Cut the loose ends, I cut 'em off, they try to say I'm a butcher
Bitch, you a rat, never mind, I changed my life, I'm Muslim
I talked to Chops on FaceTime, he say, ""Damn, you back smokin'""
He say, ""That back door damn near closed,"" I say, ""It's back open""
I say, ""These blocks could be back one,"" he say, ""You back hopin'""
You gotta watch them niggas you love 'cause they still backdoorin'
He ain't got no hope in beatin' his trial because he lost his motion
Bro got life, he don't know how pussy smell, that's why he fuck his lotion
I know some real niggas would lose it all for a viral moment
My dreads swing, I feel like Wayne, show me my opponent

You know, I like talkin' to the streets, like
When you say you the voice, you gotta, like, open up, like
Tell motherfuckers, like, what it is, like, you can't hold nothin' back
You gotta relate to them, relate to the poverty, you know what I'm sayin'?
Relate to the trenches
You know what I'm sayin', I can't be talkin' 'bout a Richard Mille all the time, know what I'm sayin'?
Some of the guys don't even know what the fuck a Richard Mille is
Know what I'm sayin'? You gotta relate
All angles, know what I'm sayin'?
The voice

These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key

I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich (Turn up)
Only twenty-five, livin' like a boss, ridin' 'round with a chauffeur
I don't sell drugs, still be paranoid, keep lookin' over my shoulder
Niggas lyin' like I'm stealin' swag, boy, that's my shit like I wrote it

Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me

Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Lil-nas-x-and-billy-ray-cyrus-old-town-road-remix-lyrics,2019-03-16

Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love

Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine

Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'

Of your uniform, your uniform of non-conformity
The tears, the tears
Tears aren't strong enough, the years aren't long enough, no

Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love

Call me when you're in the city again
My head just went oblivion
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue

Long for you (Long for you)

I wanna drink my wine, I wanna pass that by
I wanna make her cry, she wanna make me die
Apple pie, six cigarettes
And I'll catch the vibe that we can't forget

When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain?

It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue

Up in my cup, yeah
I let my feelings build up (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I just pour it up in my cup
Oh yeah, yeah

And if you said that you real, how come you gone now?
I be calm all the time, I turn up, they say, ""Calm down""
I pull up in a new Wraith, that's just what I'm on now
We dropped the top to ride around, look back, the sun down
I look around to see who hatin', count who switched on me
Peep all these new hoes in my contacts but she been on me
I like it one girl at a time, lately, I been on three
I cannot jack you, shawty, I heard that you was a skeet

You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up
I let my feelings build up
So now I just pour it up in my cup
Girl, you didn't fuck with me then
So why you fuckin' with me now?
Baby, I know you been broke
What you know about ballin' out?
You can smell X when I breathe, niggas get stretched if I bleed
Fifty K cash when I sneeze, I done went Diamond in the streets
Cut off my dog, he a leech, Glock go baow if he reach
Killers involved when I preach, asked one opp but he sleep
I'd give it all to my dawgs, motivate law when he call
A hundred and fifty on the Patek, I could've got the car with the stars
I be rappin' 'bout blocks, I'm promotin' my scars
He ain't know about the Lamb', I told 'em, ""It's ours""
From Percs to bars, from guns to cars
From coke to narc, from small to large
Who really with you when it's said and done?
They gon' try to get you, so you better run

You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up
I let my feelings build up
So now I just pour it up in my cup
Girl, you didn't fuck with me then
So why you fuckin' with me now?
Baby, I know you been broke
What you know about ballin' out?
You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up
I let my feelings build up
So now I just pour it up in my cup
Girl, you didn't fuck with me then
So why you fuckin' with me now?
Baby, I know you been broke
What you know about ballin' out?
Sometimes I miss the days of hunger, standin' in the rain
'Member when I didn't have shit to lose and everything to gain
Yes, I'm grateful for my blessings, no, I shouldn't complain
But what about when I got doubts? I woke up feeling drained
Death was just so normal in these streets, another youngin' slain
My uncle died from a shootout, left murder on my brain
Show no mercy, kill 'em all, that's how we was trained
Crime scene pictures, can't forget about them blood stains
Wounded memories, oh, I'm in need of Novocaine
Got me wishin' that these Percs could really numb the pain
Catch me, don't got my gun, I guess I'm leavin' with this chain
Long live Mike Durb, I won't let them say your name in vain

You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up
I let my feelings build up
So now I just pour it up in my cup
Girl, you didn't fuck with me then
So why you fuckin' with me now?

You don't know who gon' be there when you down
But you know who gon' be there when you up

748,5493,Lil Tjay,Lil Tjay,20/20,1,94,"I feel like the greatest
Only been at this for two years, thank God this shit happened so quick
Fashion me the latest, money comin' in but so do hatred
Shit ain't how I pictured, but I faced it
Emotions, I erased it, fuck havin' feelings, I replaced it
Should've peeped that fu' shit from the basis
This when the mistakes hit, tired of gettin' caught up in this fake shit
I just can't sit comfy with no snake shit

I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie
So if you ain't ready to die, then don't try
I gotta make it home so my mama don't cry
I'd rather do the sentence, least time'll go by
Feel the pain, so numb, I don't feel nothin'
Shooters still runnin' 'round with no chill button
Still be totin' in the town, finna drill somethin'
Let a nigga run up on me thinkin' I won't kill somethin'

And I keep the gang with me, try it, bet we air shit
Everybody get it, if it's static, we don't spare shit
Really on my bully, 2020, we ain't playin'
Now it's lit for everything, don't care 'bout what you sayin'
Mama, she was prayin', I was on that block late
Really put in twenty years of work, but then I got weight
Sunday I ain't never go to church because that block pay
Big .40 cal' in my shirt, no karate
Fuck what the opps say, fuck what the cops say
Big Smelly drive, E for E, that's the block way
If you feel a way, grrt-baow what the Glock say
All my niggas tryna get the bag, fuck the pop way
I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, ""Tjay, bro, you made it,"" I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, ""Fuck it, I don't care,"" 'cause I'm takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, huh
I'ma soon be the greatest

Words that they did not say, dick suckin' crazy
Everybody tryna beach for clout like it's wavy
Guess I'm just too real, I stood solid, how they made me
I can never be a goofy nigga if they paid me
Songs too heat now, everything is wavy
Lot of niggas think it's competition, they amaze me
I was goin' downhill, jail kinda saved me
Gotta keep the hard work, ain't no gettin' lazy
Smokin' opposition kinda sorta got me dazy
Think you'd last a day up in my shoes, then nigga, trade me
Bitch, I need a billion in blues like I'm JAY-Z
Huh, R.I.P. to Mavy
Bitch, I'm cookin' now, got the sauce like it's gravy
If you want a feature, get your money right and pay me
Still, when the time come, it might be a maybe
It depend on the type of record that you gon' play me
I can't do a wack verse, industry would trade me
Every time you hear my name, you know I'm goin' crazy
Really, I'm a trench kid, SB really made me
Really had the same goal and dream since a baby, ooh-ooh-ooh
I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, ""Tjay, bro, you made it,"" I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, ""Fuck it, I don't care,"" 'cause I'm takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, huh
I'ma soon be the greatest

I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie
So if you ain't ready to die, then don't try
I gotta make it home so my mama don't cry

Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust
Cartier glasses, 20/20, got a clear view
You a man, I don't fear you
Act up, we gon' mask up, boy, I dare you
Brody catch a body, I'ma leave you in the rearview
Could have did it to me, lil' nigga, you were scared to
You a bluff and you not who you appear to
You'd be starstruck if you see a nigga near you
And your bitch wanna fuck, I don't care to
Careful, if I say links, plan's canceled
I can have your shorty in my bed doing dance moves
Fuck that, let's get right back to the real shit
In the field shit, niggas really used to drill shit
Mama stressed out, whole lot she gotta deal with
Swear every real nigga gon' feel this
Smokin' on drugs 'cause there's too much to deal with
SB strapped up in the field with it

Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
My mama know about the pain, thought I'd never change
But looking back, for the fame, I felt the same
I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain
I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
And shit, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga
I remember catching stains in the park, nigga
Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga
My mama told me, ""Wisen up, be a smart nigga""
So all my niggas on go like a kart, nigga
Smelly drive mean a bullet to your heart, nigga
I don't really wanna speak facts, see the chart, nigga

Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down

Stuff a hundred rounds in the compact, contact
I probably fucked the bitch from your hometown projects
Opened up her mouth, put my dick all inside that
She don't get high, but she geeked off the contact
That's why I'll never, ever, ever keep in contact (Yeah)
Just closed case, so a nigga can't find that, baby, where your mind at?

Every time I go to the mall just to pop the tags
I don't really cop nothin' at the mall
First time at the mall, copped it all
Said, ""A hundred thousand,"" so I dropped it all
And that wasn't my whole bankroll
Body roll, waist roll, waist roll
Make a bitch do what I say so
Waist trained, got a bitch, taste just like ice cream
Read her text, she said, ""Girl, I scream""
Shot a nigga with a 17
Lil Uzi, yeah, I'm from the 16
Got a million, no Christine
Neck gleam, wrist gleam, fist gleam
Lil' nigga but I'm doin' big things
You ain't ever seen a nigga this clean
Pants cost two K, big jeans
And my shoes cost like sixteen

Turned a dead nigga to a blunt of weed

Wait, she was fuckin' you, who? Your cousin Vinny?

I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb

In reality, I'm 5'4""
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6""
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance

Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes, I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image

Now stay on your stomach, lil' bitch, when you lay down
Live it up, 'cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach, lil' bitch, better lay down

They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rinse it
Know my boys comin', you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it

Matchin' closet, it came with a pool

If you ask me his name then I don't have a clue (Woah)

We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke

That's just unexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them
We been to quite a few of 'em
The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

Soul snatching, that's usual

That's tomato sauce, Heinz 57
Catch up, nigga, you behind, where I left you
I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins
Uncles, aunts, and your nephew (Pfft)
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Look his pretty kid in the face, poor bastard
Tears runnin' down his bitch face, romantic
Two straps on me like the old Bo Jacksons (Bah)

Send him on the highway to heaven, no traffic
My lil' nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic
He cried tears of joy, then he got 'em tatted

I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing

Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile

Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'

Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Fab Five
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards

I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button

'Til your heart stop drummin'
I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer

I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off

And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball

I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes

No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'

Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless

Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head
He ain't got no credit and his Apple Card is dead

Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console

Mob ties, bitch, you get hog-tied, you chose the wrong side
Mrs. Whack, I love your flow, nobody rhymin' like that
Had to clean out my trunk to put your mom in the back
The cops pulled me over, they don't know your mom in the back
Big Whack makin' niggas take permanent naps
These hoes can't rap, they need a permanent pack
I ain't fuckin' with you boys, need the cervical cap
Okay, I'm bored
Okay, I'm tired
Sleepy, huh
Yeah, I don't wanna be like nobody else (Else)
Lookin' so good, I might rob myself (Self)
Realize I gotta hide the wealth (Wealth)
Told bro it's okay to be rich and stealth (Yee)
Twenty-two, I might go fuck a MILF (MILF)
My two assistants both white as milk (Milk)
Maybach, inside came soft as silk (Silk)
Put a bitch on the molly, now she tilt
This bitch been killed, built like a crushed can
Makin' rap friends more sketch than a white van
Billionaire Boat, more freedom than a white man
Fuckin' on a bitch and she sound like a hype man
Lookin' for a fly nigga, I'm what you type in (Go)

I can't get no better, can’t get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gon’ give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I’m fallin’
The world think I'm ballin’ and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who I’m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, ""Fuck 'em all""?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know

How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause ""you'll never be Kenny""
""You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole""
""You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,"" yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah

Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

Yeah, you know you made it when they make a meme for ya
Haters that never made it, I'm livin' the dream for ya
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, ""No, I don't wanna pay my bills""
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow your— follow your—, uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve

Once I release, I'm smokin' trees

Everybody hatin when i'm buzzin like a satellite givin off a wave
Ta the earth for the kids
That's TV
People wanna say, they wanna fight n get the kids all hype
Like a crowd in the night
No pg
A kid a doing it right you never knew me
But i'm coming around the corner kinda dark and no
Can't see me
I tryna to be the one who's always talkin, when i think and let it out n let it go like
Free weed

Sorry that i gotta be the one ta flip it off
But i told you ima king, so better think twice
Of lyin on a track while comin against me
I'm fiendin to give thoughts, don't plan to be nice
So i gotta give a hundred when i'm runnin
When i'm jumpin on a mic, ima say whats in my head
I don't care about the cost, i faught for the spot that i rock
Straight raw, home grown, I don't care if you talkin
Name up in your throat like coughin
No stoppin cuz i'm sick like your mom so often
I'm back up from the ground, like the dead, In a coffin
Got a bat wit a nickname, lucy, call it
Steppin in the game like look
Callin all these Mother f****** out on the truth, then the wallet
Ill be gettin what i want In the end quit stallin
I'm ready for the fun, I've been done, gonna run this
I don't wanna hear you f****** say, 'where i'm from b****  ?'
Its all up on google n now who the dumb b****
Lookin for a reason bro, for me to get dumb rich
So never am i done doin better by minute
When i'm lifted, I be gifted, when i gimmick
Wit the image like boss
I'm fully automatic, I'm n addict in the halls
Trippin like the days i was takin adderall n i'm talkin kid days
Sorry had to do it mom
Said i had to focus everyday when i was young
Took it to level now look what i become
Kxng jay, don't play
Everyday ima in the lab wit ammunition for the punks
Still pickin around the world, tell the rats from snakes
Dumb stickin around ta see how it ends aye
Livin in Atlanta full of graves n dealin wit allizeh
A holy legend fading the hell away
I met him downtown i should have known tho
Atlanta try to play you in a sick way
Be ready for the set up you gon get played
By every mother f***** that's the broke way
Learned first hand two years wit paid slots
Don't be tryna play the artist workin harder then your pops
From the 50's n 60's respect me or not
Cuz the time within my life is all i got
I took shot. My aim is good
You better watch from the city ta hoods
I'm telling these kids, If you dream then its good n to follow that s***, when you know that you should
Jay back like a tic
I'm buggin, I'm gettin pissed
Working this really hard n nobody see how lit
It's really gonna be the minute we hit a shift
N everybody lookin be patient i'm comin big, wit the steps now
Walkin the road slow I keep cool now, ooh wow
How he spittin venom, I gettin em n never sweat it
Don't forget it, make em get it like a dube cloud
Prouder then a mother f**** spittin all the truth out
Never playing wit the 808's, I don't plan ta get away
Until the day i got to, when it come I'm gonna make way
Pirate wit the life, only tryna make the dope bay
Paddle wit the raft in the tide, ain't a joke aye
We gonna get a bottle gonna chill up in the sand
Got da brother in boat n he goin full throttle
Jay up on the finger tip, baby girls fishin
Please just hear, when you do start bloggin
Aye, lemme slow this up
Lemme say this clear, for the stupid f****
Wit a slow mind, a homie had enough
But ima say this once in case you do respond
If you wanna hear what i gotta say
Wit so many words i can do that
Its only three words, said back ta back
Its 'YOU ARE A B****', so learn to read fast
Had so many years ta learn here
But lemme be clear, you'll burn here
I'm up in the world, its my work yeh
I'm gonna get what i deserve b****
Until ima corpse in the floor near
A bag full of weed buried under a stage wit the mic in my hand
Cuz ill never change, i'm climbin this game its my turn yeh
But when i get attackin, i'm taggin, i'm gonna drag em
When they rappin, when i say its gonna happen, Its gon happen
Ain't no question on the matter, i'm handle all the hatters
Haters
Braggin everyday bein hella instigators on the side be talkin I see the plot, you be hatin on a nigga tryna get up in the spot
N ima get it better watch, n get you mad like ha

Spittin all the cold on the earth for the genocide
Ain't nowhere to go you better hide before the homicide
Promise ima get it cuz im Ready for the punks
Is there anything i missed, death, yeh

What gives ’em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country
You do your kind of country

It don't mean that I won't be right by your side

And you can't see me in the middle of the night

It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone

A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

I ain't had much else going on
So I sat down and wrote this song

I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
It's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band

Wants an ice cold beer and a country song

But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me

After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, ""Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?""
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

A lifetime of music gone just to get me through
Momma always had her a second job
Gone with the sun until six o’clock
Whatever it took to get by she was gonna do
Didn’t dawn on me back then but now I see
Without them, I wouldn’t be me

When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
But me don’t mean a thing without you

You make sacrifices every night and day
Never hear the crowd scream your name
But there’s a smile and a hand to hold when the show is through
I’d give it all up just to keep your love
But you wouldn’t let me because you care too much
About watching me watch my dreams all come true
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
But me don’t mean a thing without you

You worked overtime to buy those tickets
The gas, the beer and the babysitters
Just to spend one night with your baby at a country show
Paid twenty damn dollars for a place to park
Got in line early to grab your spot
So you deserve every word, every line of your favorite tune

When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson

When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road

Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'

Ever since I can remember, I've been keepin' it together, but I'm feelin' strange

Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down
Yeah, well, I'm just being honest, my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time, the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turnin' 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie, though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make-believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walkin', droppin' change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity, um, I move carelessly, that's why I'm always trippin'
I guess it's like electrolytes, you help me go the distance
Not too efficient, but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right

So put on that red suit and make him appear

Just ain't the same without my baby

These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love

We're broken, we're broken

Got me sprung, wrapped in sheets
Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

With the ocean color stuck in your iris
We comfortable in silence
But I prefer it when we wilding
Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress (Woo!)

I've moved everywhere but on

Who I am without you and why I still think about you

But I'm a believer

'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it

'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you

'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)

Follow your dreams, not your addictions
How we gon' follow our dreams locked in a prison?
They tried to swallow me whole, God be my witness
Deprive me out of my dreams but I'm relentless
I want the money, ain't never want attention
So I don't pay attention to comments and all the mentions
'Cause they ain't see my vision
I was washin' dishes 'til my rags turned into riches
Glad when it was Christmas
We ain't even barely get presents, but we was gifted
In the school of failure, we present, perfect attendance
Welfare baby, we workin' with what they give us
Made me some commas, judge still gave me a sentence
No period, city girls don't get scared when it's really real
When your bank account twenty mil' and your house up on a hill
And your fam in the driveway, you walk out and see the grill
Thank God you believe, make sure you pray when you kneel, yeah
You know I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)

My bank account, it was on super-zero
Ain't never panic, I'm a superhero (Uh)
Target my goals and I'ma shoot the arrow
When God turned the heat up on me, he said ""You De Niro""
Play your part, got some brains like the scarecrow
Let's play it smart, 'cause we ain't playin' checkers, this is chess, play your pawns
Sit back like a king, when they move, make your mark
And never ever let your competition take your heart (Take your heart)
Say I believe in myself
When everybody stop believin', never leave on yourself
They had my back against the wall, I had to lean on myself
Almost made me put my dreams on the shelf, I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
Laws of attraction, you just think I'm rappin'
I'm just puttin' out the energy so I can grab it
Everything that's in my memory that I imagined
It's finally here, hundred million in a year
I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down

As I lay (As I lay) me down to sleep (Down to sleep)
Pray the Lord (Pray) my soul to keep (Soul to keep)
Fallen ones, (Fallen ones) rest in peace (R.I.P.)
Please, God, watch over me (Watch over me)

You ain't my dawg, you fallin' out about no lawyer fee (No lawyer fee)
You had a brick and I ain't even have a quarter key
You never seen my hand out, I knew it was more to me
It's more than us to see our sons and all our daughters eat
'Cause I got cops tryna lock me, opps out tryna slaughter me
But I stay prayed up, loadin' all these K's up
'Cause I ain't get advicе from all them nights back when I stayed up
Don't hit mе 'bout no show if you ain't come to set the stage up
We God body, threw a thousand shots, they barely grazed us
And I can't let 'em make my grave up

I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought that Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know the shit that I'm against, ayy

And I'm talking 'bout all the different niggas (Different niggas)
And I don't get these niggas (Get these niggas)
Why these niggas tryna hang like they ain't lynchin' niggas? (They ain't lynchin' niggas)

I know an opp, he was suspect, now he a victim with it (Victim with it)

Had a lot of murder on my mind, but in God, I fear
Took Yompton and Crenshaw around the globe in a year (Woah)

Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)

You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

You accidentally bring him to the wedding, whoops
If you pour yourself a Merlot to go
You dip your fries in your ketchup on a bumpy road
You spill the beans to your mama, sister got knocked up

I'm still the same nigga from minimum wage
They tryna keep up, so they stalkin' my page
They do what I say, they tryna get saved
They line up for me like they coppin' the J's
I told her get right, start acting your age
Can't believe you tried it, bitch, you played
Wanted a diamond choker, soon as her time was over, bitch, you played
She wanna ride the Rover, told her her Uber was closer, bitch, you crazy
She tried to show out in public, I cut the bitch off like it's nothin', bitch, you played
She must've thought I was stupid, I knew she was fuckin' my cousin
Bitch, you played4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Moneybagg-yo-u-played-lyrics,2020-01-18

I ain't ever ran from a nigga (No I ain't never, ever), if I did, cut my legs off (Right now)
I ain't ever been with the ho talk, snitch talk, always talking 'bout his fault (No)
Yeah, I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up, nigga, you don't wanna see me pissed off (Real talk)
Never tell a lie to a bitch, dawg (No), when it come to them, you gotta play it raw
And I ain't never ever let the fuckery get to me (Why not?) Niggas ain't worth my energy (What you had to do?)
Cut 'em off, make 'em feel it, I ain't dealin' with nothin' if it don't make sense to me (Never ever, ever)
I'll never ever, ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side (Never ever, ever)
I'll never ever, ever put a bitch 'fore the money, gotta get it when it come to mine

Lately I feel like it's me versus me, don't see competition, why would you compete? (Huh?)
Don't even gotta be woke, still gon' be up (How?), I make a bag in my sleep (Okay)
Can't get the hood outta me, you know where I be (Where?) Still posted up like I lease (Now)
Trust me, them choppers gon' bang, cavity teeth, you better not think this shit sweet (Splat)
If the bitch bad put a stack in her rack (Go)
I'm Dr. Seuss, give me cat in the hat (Woah)
Booty poke out and her stomach on snatch
Way to pretty to be fucked from the back (Ugh)
Count up some money then smoke me a plant
This shit got me higher than Ja Morant (Up there)
Toxic lil' bitch and she knowin' she that
I said I was done, still doubled back
If you a side bitch you can not question me
You did some foul shit, you threw a TEC at me
Cook it up right, they done gave me the recipe
I'm in a Z06, police ain't catchin' me
I'm still duckin' this bitch that's obsessed with me
'Cause I'm the dope like the coke in the '70s
Big body double R truck, I got Bo with me
Hoggin' the lane, now they can't get close to me (Big bag)
I ain't ever ran from a nigga (No I ain't never, ever), if I did, cut my legs off (Right now)
I ain't ever been with the ho talk, snitch talk, always talking 'bout his fault (No)
Yeah, I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up, nigga, you don't wanna see me pissed off (Real talk)

Cut 'em off, make 'em feel it, I ain't dealin' with nothin' if it don't make sense to me (I can't deal)
I'll never ever, ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other side (Never ever, ever)
I'll never ever, ever put a bitch 'fore the money, gotta get it when it come to mine

Check the thermostat, I've been hot four summers (Hot)
Try me, you get whacked, make it hard for your mama
Moneybagg Runtz in the pack, get a bundle
Plaque and the sack, both of 'em doing numbers
I ain't got a heart for a ho, that's a big no (No go)
No-life worry 'bout the next ho (Why, though?)
Took back the keys to the Benzo
All in her feelings, throwin' clothes out the window (Psycho)
Let's take a AK, cut it in half and call it a Draco (Let's go)
I'm back on my old ways, ridin' with that five, volcano that fuego
Life insurance on my chain (Your life)
Reach for it, bust your brain (Night, night)
Loose noodle, no lo mein (Take out)
Going out the way I came (Same route)
I ain't ever ran from a nigga (No I ain't never, ever), if I did, cut my legs off (Right now)
I ain't ever been with the ho talk, snitch talk, always talking 'bout his fault (No)
Yeah, I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up, nigga, you don't wanna see me pissed off (Real talk)

Huh? (What?)
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' (Ah)
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' (Ain't sayin' nothin')
We gon' trap this bitch out 'til the feds come (Run it up, run it up)
Huh? (What she say?)
Ah, I thought a pussy ho said somethin' (Ah)
How it goes, when I'm talkin, you listen (Just listen)
Cut her off 'cause she spoke on the business (Go)

Hundreds and fifties, can't swap a dime for a penny
You know that's a stupid decision (Yup)
Headfirst with it
I shot a shot at my nigga bitch, really didn't think before I did it (No)
Make it make sense (Please)
Luckily, I was on point with the last ho, kept my receipts (Why?)
Warranty good, made sure I got a full refund when I gave her back to the streets (Go)
Forever I rep, put the set on the chain
I'm thuggin', you already know how I came (Know how)
Yeah, he got money, but niggas be lame
I Lambo'd her life, told her, ""Get out that Range""
Her mani and pedi same color as my teeth (White)
She got a blue check and a check without me (Nice)
Hood nigga ridin' in a foreign on E (Still)
Sick of these niggas, COVID-19 (Ugh)
Karate’d the wock, he tryna kick the cup  (Shake it)
Came up like Giannis, I get bigger bucks (Made it)
Got four different choppers, right there in this truck (Now)
I'm just being honest, I could get you touched (Brr)
Put you in the blender, I could get you slushed (Haha)
I see the comments but really unbothered
I know it's hurtin', she salty, I scarred her
Beware what you lay up and say to these bitches, they can't hold water (Period)
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' (Ah)
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' (Ain't sayin' nothin')
We gon' trap this bitch out 'til the feds come (Run it up, run it up)

How it goes, when I'm talkin, you listen (Just listen)
Cut her off 'cause she spoke on the business (Go)

I thought a nigga who watch what I do
But he can't get his bitch back said somethin' (Tough)
Is it true that he postin' another nigga money?
Probably, I don't put that past him (Maybe so)
I thought a ho that be speakin' on me
But be fuckin' a broke nigga said somethin' (Listen)
Hol' up, lil' bitch, get a nigga that's lit
I'm the whole loaf, he the breadcrumbs (Go)
Rappers with their mixed feelings (What?)
I ain't fuckin' with 'em (Nope)
Like a Richard Mille, let me know what time it is
Bagg, where the Runtz at? (Huh?) Know you got it on you '
'Posed to be smell-proof, bussin' out the vacuum seal
These niggas lil' boys, childish, Fisher Price
Confident, I'm not cocky, so get it right
She bendin' over, but I want some head first
I don't even wanna know what the pussy like
Trippin' too close to fallin', so I'm ballin'
It's crazy, my opp got shot but I ain't call it (Sike, slow up)
I come around, niggas gon' put they ho up
These bitches stay on my channel, yeah
Must've seen me on TV, yeah
It took me six hours to count a mil' exactly, I'm accurate with the cheese, yeah (Big Bagg)
Huh? (What?)

Big speaker, one thing about it I'ma stand  (All the way up)
I'm not the one I think you should fuck with
Just lettin' you know in advance (No)
I got a goon holdin' a burner
You can get left with a tan (Fire)
He a junkie for the dumb shit (How?)
Want all the smoke like a strand (Dope)
Just protecting the brand (You gotta protect the brand)
Too much to count right now, I don't got enough hands
(Right now it's just me in here with it)
They dissin', I know that they wishin' I give 'em a chance
(Never get tricked out the spot)
You reach, I blank, you stank, I'm goin' to the can (Goin' fed)
For protecting the brand (Said what I said)
Just protecting the brand (Hey, go)

Get the drop, go hit up his block (Right now)
The chopper hold ninety-nine plus one
That's a 100 some shots for a opp (Brr)
Put on for my city every time I drop
Couple niggas stuck and they mad that I'm not
Hate that I'm hot like what's under the pot
Got 'em where I want 'em, I hear that a lot
(Hey, who you is? Tell 'em)
Big speaker, big stepper, still in rotation with the trappers and the jackers
Hot boy ridin' with the pump, asthma
Double R truck, red seats, plasma
I'm hittin' a bitch from the back, got her sayin' the brand
And free all the bros out the can (Gang)
Never see him, so we clappin' his mans like hands
Why would you play with the clan?
F and the N, A and the R
Infrared beam, it glow in the dark
Put in the work and don't tell what you saw
I'm a big driver, controllin' the car (Big bands)
They ridin', I'm wrong or right (Don't matter)
Lil' niggas tote choppas my height (6'3)
I flooded the brand' in ice (On me)

For protecting the brand (Huh? Huh?)
Just protecting the brand (Okay)

You know the brand, we winnin' (Let's go)
Better ask 'bout DaBaby and see what they say
That lil' nigga ain't playin', he wit' it (Yeah)
Nigga know I keep fire on me 24/7
You get cooked like a pan, a skillet by protecting the brand
How you standin' on that? I come step on you like you a pair of tennis (Okay)
Ain't that what they call it in Memphis? (Uh-huh)
Know a few niggas ballin' in Memphis (Ball)
Got a bag, I'm with Bagg, I'ma let you know (Yeah)
If I pull that bitch out, I'ma let it blow (Boom)
Nigga, you know I'm hot, and my bitch a hot girl
We'll pop out like we Meg and Yo
It was time to go right by the brand and your boy showed his hand
That lil' nigga was scared to go
I think these niggas scared of the label
Got a brand with my brand, way ahead of your label
We made niggas famous
Put one of yo ass on the news, now your mama scared of the cable
Ayy, baby, what you gon' do if a nigga walk down
And he caught himself checkin' the label?
Tell my lil' brother, ""Pass me that AR""
Like I'm askin' for salt and pepper at the table
'Cause I'm a

Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway
But I wonder when you're drinking if you

Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
“I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along
So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book

Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks, a backroad gets old
But for me, it just can't

'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say

Mustard on the beat, ho

I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep

I been wakin' up to get the money, woah, woah
Got a bad bitch, her ass tatted, woah, woah
Givenchy to my toes, two twins, I'm fucking 'em both
I put her in a new AP, the water like a boat
I was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
I seen you swerve back, 'cause I'm in the black 'Bach
New diamonds on me, fuck a flash, this ain't Snapchat
'Cause I been gettin' paid
Yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade
Got my baby mama that new Bentayga
Tryna get the dough, Joe, like a sensei, yeah
Rolls Royce umbrellas when I'm in the rain
I just mind my business
I got brothers that did the time, I ain't kiddin'
All these rappers just talk about it, I live it

When I was broke, I was feelin' uneasy
Now I get paid and I'm feelin' relieved

Call up a thottie, I hit when I please
Whatever it take, might just pay her to leave
My bitch Latina, my choppa is Russian
Wheezy on beats, that's expensive percussion
Can't get no Act', so we sippin' on red
Can't talk to my bro 'cause he still in the feds
Can't get these demons up outta my head
Can't slide on the opps 'cause they already dead

Invisible set, diamonds huggin' my piece
Book me for a show, I need eighty at least
I want the smoke, ain't no keepin' the peace
Keep me a razor when I'm in the East
Open 'em up just like a surgery
Everything burnin' around me, I'm lit
Show a lil' attitude, swap out the bitch
I spent two-fifty, don't know where it went
My hood on my back, I gotta represent
Toronto, you useless, you don't got a pole
Warm that boy up, he got shot in the cold
Thirty rounds in the clip, let it unload

Took twenty bitches on my first vacay

Hey!
Leave me alone

Panic-stricken, handle business, not a joke, yeah
Manners missin', travel different, no control, yeah
Time to listen, time to zip it, keep it closed
My description, highly gifted, take some notes, yeah
Lack of interest, why'd you visit? Hit the road, yeah
I'm kinda twisted, so keep your distance, be a ghost
Yeah, see I'm inventive, but quite the menace, you ain't know?
Well then I'm offended, let's jog your memories, here we go, yeah
I went from nobody to kinda famous
Hide my plaques inside the closet, I just can't explain it
My wife, she tells me that she's proud and thinks that I should hang 'em
But I just leave 'em on the ground right next to my self-hatred
Yeah, yeah, mental health, where's my mental health?
Diagnosed with OCD, what does that mean? Well, gather 'round
That means I obsessively obsess on things I think about
That means I might take a normal thought and think it's so profound (Leave me alone)
Ruminating, fill balloons up full of doubts
Do the same things, if I don't, I'm overwhelmed (Leave me alone)
Thoughts are pacing, they go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's so draining, let's move onto something else, fine (Oh) (Leave me alone)
Runnin' the game, but they don't even know it
Like I'm undercover and don't wanna blow it
I come out of nowhere, they don't even notice
The flow is so cold, you would think it was snowin' (Oh) (Leave me alone)
I'm under the weather, but wind isn't blowin'
I got an umbrella for difficult moments
You got to admit it, I'm very devoted
I'm out in the rain, but it don't always open, so I (I, I)
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid (More afraid)
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Don't wanna change)
Tell them how I feel, but they remain the same (Same)
Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy, leave me alone! (Oh)

Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! (Leave me alone)

I hate when they debate if we're underrated
We're so overlooked that they're lookin' over our numbers, Nathan (Leave me alone)
We don't do enough interviews or go out in public lately
We don't post enough on our socials
To keep the buzz from fading (Leave me alone)
Let it fade, yeah, let it fade
Once it's decimated, then you drop a song outta nowhere
And all the fans embrace it (Leave me alone)
Then the buzz will surface again, it's part of my operation
I don't need advice from my doubts right now
End of conversation (Leave me alone)
Shut your mouth, yeah, shut your mouth
Better tone it down, close it now
If you make a sound, I'ma change the dial (Leave me alone)
Funny how they be acting loud, comin' unannounced
It's floating 'round
Man, the kid is wild, pretty vile, true (Leave me alone)
I'm kinda funny but don't really show it
I keep it together but have a disorder
I go to my room and I sit in my corner
And talk to myself in a language that's foreign (Leave me alone)
I think of a rhyme and I have to record it
But know if I don't, I'll wake up in the mornin'
And question my life again, always avoiding
I hate to be different, but hate to be normal, so I (Leave me alone)
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Wanna change)
Tell them how I feel but they remain the same (They remain the same)
Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy
Leave me alone

Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone

Remember back in ""NO NAME,"" I said fame called? (Yeah, yeah)
Told you I hung up, it kinda felt wrong (Leave me alone) (Wrong, wrong)
Finally called him back, we didn't talk long (No)
He asked me how I'd been, I sent him this song (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Yeah, think he took offense, he kinda seemed off (Off)
I texted him that night to ask what he thought (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
It took a couple days to get a response
But once I finally did, he said this song sucks (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Feel the symptoms, couldn't miss 'em, wrestle with 'em
Then I pin and flip 'em, brought some back up
No, well, you should get some (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Who you dissin'? Mood is switchin', don't come in the kitchen
You should listen, cookin' record for my hands are blisterin'
So persistent, don't forget this, hold the tension, soul is bendin'
No pretendin', open-ended, low percentage, so demented (Leave me alone)
Whole consensus, flow tremendous, no apprentice, dope incentive
Show intensive, so possessive, tone aggressive, watch your step when I (Leave me alone)
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face (Up my face)
I can feel them weighin' on me every day (Yeah, every day)
I should let 'em go and watch them float away (Yeah, float away)
But I'm scared if I do then I'll be more afraid
Leave me alone (Yeah), leave me alone, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I don’t know, it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (Last night)
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah (Bus rides)
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (Air out)
I’ve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (But hey)
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm sayin', and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith, woo
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (Ah)
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist

Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed

I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal

Everything I oversee, I just like to overthink
Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? ""No""
Come on, let me play a couple tracks, ""No""
Come on, I can spit it really fast, ""No""
You think I should throw this in the trash? ""No""
Tricked ya; haters, go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well, I forgive ya
I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know

Send a hit at five, he was dead by six (By six)
Got shot seven times, but the eighth shot missed
Nine shots in the clip, could've sworn it was ten
Didn't fuck with 12, I was eleven again
I need me a trophy, the best to sin
You niggas ain't straight, y'all lesbians
And fuck your dead homie, I'll say it again
If he come back to life, he dead again
Try to fight me, he gon' fight for his life (Bitch)
Swing with what? I'ma swing with the pipe
(He's not cherishin' it), ayy, take his life
Straitjacket music, I belong in the psych
Felonies and felonies, this what they keep on sellin' me (Yeah, yeah)
This recipe is deadly, see, I be drippin' like relish be (Ayy, ayy)
Shoot him in the head, shoulda had on a hard hat (Ayy)
We finish the beef as soon as you start that (Ayy)
Bitch, I shoot first, why the fuck would I spark back?
If you really a thug, let me see where your heart at (Ayy)
If I say catch a body, lil' nigga, you catchin' it?
If I tell you run off, is you really finessin' it? (Ayy)
If I give you a brick, are you gon' sell that shit? (Ayy)
If you get in a jam, are you gon' start tellin' shit?
Where is the smoke? 'Cause bitch, I'm inhalin' it
Just like the army, we got some artillery
Can they free my dawgs? I'm being sincerely
'Nother opp died, a nigga like, ""Seriously?"" (Damn, another one?)
Nigga, we shot him, and then we killed his brother, damn
We might as well get the mother
He say he don't like doing drills, I love 'em
If my brother don't like him, I don't
Somebody tell him he in trouble
I paid too much for my motherfuckin' guns for me to scuffle
Gangster young nigga, I feel like Gucci (Gucci)
Fucked her so hard, left blood on her coochie
Made her said, ""Ooh,"" put my thumb in her booty
I'll be damned, this dumb ass ho just pooted
Who ain't with the murder? Lil' nigga, I kill
That night he died, that was my idea
Told my niggas slide, make sure he don't live
But that's a lil' secret, just keep it concealed
My metal a MAC and I bet I attack
It's a hundred-some shots in this gat, so get back
He thought I was lyin', that shit was a fact
Got shot in his spine, but you watchin' his back
(He say he don't like doing drills, I love 'em)
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, haha
(Strait, straitjacket music, I belong in the psych)
Fuck a nigga, what a nigga, fuck a nigga mean? (He say he don't like doing drills, I love 'em)
Know what I'm sayin'? Haha

Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch

Keep the vision through the lights, never blinded by the hype
Keep the Tommy near the belly, sincere 'cause I'm hype

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

Eu estou num carro novo, eu e a New New quando eu chego
Eu digo ao manobrista: Estacione a minha Benz e traga o Rolls Royce
Yo, espere, espere, espere, ok, espere
Ele me vê linda toda vez que ele passa minhas fotos
Talvez eu deixo a arma te acertar se você aprontar
Agora ponha as mãos para o alto, é um assalto
Me passe o dinheiro (Vai!)

Porque eu tenho sido a vadia má, Barbie Tingz, exibindo o corpão (Vai!)
Todo mundo fica em cima do meu pau, eu tenho que ser (Vai!) franca
Chupe um pau se você duvidou de mim
No banco de trás do Maybach, no banco de trás do Maybach
No banco de trás do Maybach,  no banco de trás do Maybach (Woo!)

Então nunca vamos odiar os tabloides
Eu deixo os meus filhos na sala de recreação
Pra que a gente não se encontre no mesmo espaço

E se você me deixar comer sua buceta, então será a semana do tubarão
""Olá, queria falar com o Tunechi?"" ""Posso saber quem está falando?""
Todo mundo tem um suco sem uma jarra pra colocá-lo
Eu quero ter e comer o bolo, e depois eu já estou faminto
Eu me sinto o Adão, mas estou prestes a comer a maçã em cima de você
Relógio no lado certo, agora vocês estão no meu tempo
Por favor, saia de cima do meu pau, antes que ele exploda
Os olhos parecendo que eu estou em algum lugar de Taiwan
Chapado pra caralho como sempre, oi, mãe
Olha cara, eu darei um chute na sua bunda com os meus sapatos sofisticados
Seja meu tamborete
Disse ao meu advogado pra só me ligar se tiver boas notícias
Daí meu telefone começou a tocar fora do gancho, que preguiça

Porque eu tenho sido a vadia má, Young Money é um exército
Ele não curte brinquedos, mas ele transa com a Barbie
É o presidente, Mônica é como eles me chamam
Nicki, a ninja, Nicki, a patroa
Nicki, a Harajuku, ah
Remix, baby

Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' ""Dixieland Delight""
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
We got a spot a couple miles outta town
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
We got them foldin' chairs leanin way back
No other plans other than relax
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow from where we at

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time
Way down here, we all got that Southern drawl
Take our time when we talkin', ""Hey Y'all""
Yeah, it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three, two
That's time I got to you
That money, my dreams come true
My life in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew?
Who knew?

Turned seven to a fourteen
Fourteen to a whole thing
Lord knows it's a cold game
Switched up on you hoes, man
Big body take both lanes
Backseat, blowin' propane
All-black, five gold chains
Young rich nigga bossed up on his own, man
My new shit sound like it's ""Soul Train""
Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain
RSC, we for sure bang
Tiny Locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the '80s? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
But you drove to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they quotes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix with my sack for the whole day
Drive-bys, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school, play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage

I'd leave it behind if you let me
Ironic, I'd drown just to hold you down
I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I bring you up, you just let me down
Let me down (Uh, let me down)
(Need my All Money In chain too)
Let me down (Woah, let me down, look out, look out)

It's hard to catch what you can't see
I grew up to be who I wanna be, so
The more niggas talk, I'ma shine
Might've been way before its time
Posted with my back against the wall
Life is a bitch, but she mine
The rag six-deuce, yeah, it's mine
The Westside too, yeah, it's mine
What you know about
Your poster on the wall at the dealership?
Leave her in the bed, legs tremblin'
Gettin' banged on for your Pendletons
What you know about
Your response be the reason you exist?
Lucky I ain't get caught up in the twist
Young nigga, blue pager on my hip, so
As the champagne spill
And the car accelerate and the beat gon' cry
I be goin' to the bank at least three, four times
Getting handshakes from the branch managers
We keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut

941,1492,Nipsey Hussle Featuring Kendrick Lamar,Nipsey Hussle,Dedication,2,93,"Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedication, look
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, ""You do a song with Nip, K. Dot, he a better Crip""
I said, ""He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?""
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up

Look
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, ""Stay safe,"" now it's, ""Stay dangerous""
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(TrapAdix)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I was ridin' ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay

I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look
I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin’ up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, ""Nigga, live your life and grow""
I'd tell you, ""Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 'til the pipe in smoke""
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck

Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could

I'm prolific, so gifted
I'm the type that's gon' go get it, no kiddin'
Breaking down a Swisher front of your buildin'
Sitting on the steps, feeling no feelings
Last night, it was a cold killin'
You gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga
But you know how it go, nigga
I'm front line every time it's on, nigga
Hunnid proof flow, run and shoot pro
458 drop, playin' ""Bullet Proof Soul""
Every few shows, I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller, everybody can't go
Downtown, Diamond District, jewelers like, ""Yo
Hussle, holla at me, I got Cubans on the low""
Flew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat
Then docked at Tulum just to smoke, look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
I'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it
They tell me, ""Hussle, dumb it down, you might confuse 'em""
This ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
I'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section
Can't express how I curved detectives
Guess it's evidence of a divine presence, blessings
Held me down, at times, I seem reckless, F it
You got an L, but got an E for effort, stretched him
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert, then left him
Ain't no answer to these trick questions
Money Makin' Nip, straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known, flick up and jail pose
Snatch a champagne bottle from Rico's 'til T show
Whatever, nigga, playin' chess, not checkers, nigga
Thirty-eight special for you clever niggas
See, bro, if you ain't live and die by the street code
Been through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I wanna hear your CD for?

Yeah, look
I'm finna take it there
This time around, I'ma make it clear
Spoke some things into the universe and they appeared
I say it's worth it, I won't say it's fair
Find your purpose or you wastin' air
Fuck it, though, y'all niggas scared
Eyes opened, I can see it clear
They don't make 'em bar none, they don't make 'em real
They don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here
They ain't see in due time, I be makin' mils
Bossed up in this game, I been makin' deals
Get your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real
I got checks and balance, I flex dramatic
Other fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit
Ain't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage
I make one phone call and the rest get handled
It's just another front step with candles
Lil' message from the set, ""We accept your challenge""
Woah-oh

Woah, woah

It was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked (Checked)
I was sellin' zones in the set (Zones up in the set)
Make a quarter mil' no sweat
Last time that I checked
I'm the streets' voice out West
Legendary, self-made progress
Last time that I checked (Checked)
First, you get the money, then respect
Then the power and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked (Checked)

I been self-made from the dribble
I was been sayin' I'ma kill em, look
Playing no games with you niggas
Pop clutch, switch lanes on you niggas, look
I laid down the game for you niggas
Taught you how to charge more than what they paid for you niggas
Own the whole thing for you niggas
Reinvest, double up, then explain for you niggas
It gotta be love, who run the city? It gotta be cuz
This for the pieces I took off the Monopoly board
And y'all niggas' false claims, it gotta be fraud
Just keep the hood up out your mouth or you gotta be charged
I doubled up, tripled up, nigga, what?
Banged on the whole game, I ain't give a fuck
Nobody trippin', handled business, got my digits up
And when I drop, you know I'm 'bout to fuck the city up
Last time that I checked

Then the power and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked (Checked)

And I come through fly (Check), no cosign
I ain't need radio to do mine, I done fine
And I take my time (Check), and take my tribe
Every level that I crossed in this game like state lines
It was visionary, either I'm genius or you niggas scary
Maybe it's both, and this balance I deliver daily
For every nigga in these streets tryna feed the babies
The single mamas working hard not to miss a payment
And dirty money get washed on royalty statements
Black owners in this game of powerful racists
Young niggas in the set that's doing it makeshift
Out the garage is how you end up in charge
That's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars
That's how you start off a curb-server, end up a boss
That's how you win the whole thing and lift up a cigar
With sweat dripping down your face 'cause the mission was hard
Last time that I checked
It was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked (Checked)

Then the power and the hoes come next (Uh-oh)
Last time that I checked (Checked)

I got the front end and the back
We on the way and that's a fact (Facts, nigga)
This real, this ain't rap
Where everybody wanna act pro-Black (They don't really wanna fuck with us)
The last lie you heard, this ain't that
This that I done made it out the gutter shit
Nip told you, ""Fuck the middleman,"" I told you, ""Fuck a bitch""
Fuck wearing they clothes, I wear my own shit
Y'all can own y'all label, I own my own, bitch
Ayy, Nip, I remember all that game you throwed me
Don't fuck around and get played by these label owners
Talk that shit to these niggas, Adrien Broner
But secure the win, though, don't let that game fold you
'Cause when it's game over, it's really game over
And all they do is play the game 'til this game over
And you be giving game like a big brother
Mission, never let 'em take it from us, no
Last time that I checked
It was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep

So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you better than I do, darling, I know

Confinement mind (Confinement)
How you feelin' when you face a dime? (Time)
The truth be told (Told)
I'm supposed to be locked up and dead, cold (Cold)
In the mind of an old (He cold) white man, the black man soul
Felt like I was born on Mars (Mars)
Everybody starin' too hard (Starin')
They didn't really think I was a star (They didn't really)
Then I fucked around, beat the odds (Fucked around)
How did I get right here? (How did I?)
Neck, wrist on chandelier (Chandelier)
Made me wanna drop some tears (Tears)
Thankin' God that I switched gears (Whooo)
I'm from another lightyear, I'm a Martian (Martian)
One-third of a human, just partial (One third)
I'm the Sergeant, the Captain, the Marshal (Serge)
I start to barf, it was too much potion
Too fast, everything in slow motion
I get the cash and my money keep grossin' (Get the cash)
Popped a bottle, champagne, we toastin'
Suicide doors on the coupe when they open (Skrrt)
They didn't believe in me (Nah)
Check the stats, number one, you see (You see)
I bet my haters can't breathe
Nigga, don't even compare to me (Nah)
Street niggas, we rare, unique (We rare)
We can fuck 'em by the pair, by the three (By the pair)
Chopper soundin' like a snare in a beat (Like a snare)
I'm from the A, I love your ass, it's a peach (Peach)
Where I'm from, niggas cash, don't lease (Cash)
Where I'm from, the stick's on the backseat (Stick sticks)
Where I'm from, police put you six feet
A lot of bums and they sleepin' on the street (Bums)
Yeah, yeah, that's at home (Yeah)
Nigga, go back to your fam' where you dead wrong (Go back)
Miss my dawg, dead and gone (Miss him)
I can hear his voice telling me ""Don't go alone"" (Pistol)
Yeah, the money can't fix that (Nah)
Dirty money, had to rinse that (Dirty money)
I try my hardest not to look back (I try)
Not too long ago a nigga would've took that (Gimme that)
This for my niggas had to cook packs (Cook cook)
Million dollar trap fall 'cause of one rat (Rats)
Yeah, ain't no comin' back (Yeah)
How I made it out the jungle, yeah, without a scratch (Hey)
Where I'm at? (Where) Where I go? (How) How did I get here? (How did I get here?)
Walk around with a Smithfield (Smithfield)
I'm from the south, had a gold grill (Gold grill)
Remember doin' shows in Mobile (Mobile)
Go against me and it's roadkill (Roadkill)
Wakin' up to see the sunrise (Sunrise)
I turned five, I got baptized (Baptized)
We was livin' up in College Park (College Park)
Midnight, heard the gunfight (Gunfight)
Playin' football at Forest Park (Forest Park)
Gresham Park where your moment get defined (Get defined)
The story of my life (The life)
Way before I ever wrote a rhyme (Way before)
Have you ever done time? (Time)

How you feelin' when you face a dime? (Time)
The truth be told (Told)
I'm supposed to be locked up and dead, cold (Cold)
In the mind of an old (He cold) white man, the black man soul

Baptized at First Baptist Church
The pastor name was Reverend Johnson (Okay)
Chastised his shirt and matchin' shoes
But had to front, it never bothered him (Okay)
Hurt his pride but he swallowed it (Okay)
Dirt is all that he spotted
And in the dirty south where bodies pilin' up
So high, they block the birds and rerouted 'em (Damn)
Plenty murderers had observers but
You never heard a peep out of them
So many funerals it ain't enough numerals to keep count of them (Woah)
Look, I'm just settin' the scene
Back when I stared at the phone as I'm lettin' it ring
Another collector, they leave us a message
My mama in deficit, must intervene
I bust out the seams, I'm gettin' too big for these britches now
I invest in the dream, I'm destined for green
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
And I think about that when I dig 'em out
(When I dig 'em out, when I dig 'em out)
Where I'm at? (Where) Where I go? (How) How did I get here? (How did I get here?)

Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block

I know you get sick of this soul-sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me

Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me

Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there

Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No

I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues
If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone

'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band

When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'

I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van

He held the door, held my hand in the dark

Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Walk me home in the dead of night
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
Say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind

If we're a million miles apart, do you think you'd walk away?
If I get lost in all the noise, even if I lose my voice
Flirt with all the other boys, what would you say?

Could you?
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?

Is it for better or for worse, or am I just your good time girl?
Can you still hold me when it hurts, or would you walk away?
Even if I scandalize you, cut you down and criticize you
Tell a million lies about you, what would you say?

Let's get it straight, girl, you don't need a nigga for nothin'
Lookin' better every day, you got that Benjamin Button
Claimin' he don't got a girl, you know niggas be frontin'
You don't need no bitch comin' up to you as a woman (Ayy)

Ran down on a bitch, she almost pissed on her leg
Bitches think they fuckin' with me, must be sick in the head
Why don't you chill with the beef and get some chicken instead?
Got the crown, shut it down, have them hype up in the 6

Caught my first case, then I got kicked out my mama house
Got nowhere to stay, bitch, I'm runnin' in your fuckin' house (Bitch)

Bond tight with my day ones, ain't tryna find no recruits
We was playin' give and take on that front line with my troops

Keep two lil' savages on X and they gon' get it done
And them hollow tips do surgery, they gon' clip his lungs

Livin' by the gun, put all my trust into this compact
My niggas went to war, but they ain't get no Vietnam check
Lil' bro want his head, he tryna make his brains ooze
Lil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues

Every time that I pop out, bustdown VVs, designer drippin' (Designer drippin')

Bitch, I'm from Chiraq, when it get hot, they bring them TECs out
Better watch your back or you'll be on that corner stretched out
Quick to change a nigga standin' tall with his chest out
And they like headshots, it won't make sense to bring a vest out
Shit be devastatin', you find out your homie checked out
Parents lose control, don't know her daughter havin' sex now
Niggas hatin', I'm gettin' paper, that's what they pressed 'bout
Went down the wrong path, switched it up and chose the best route
I ain't used to have it all, I used to feel left out
'Member I was broke, ain't have a dollar, I was stressed out
Now I'm tryna get richer, like Blast, let's bring the jets out

For any problem, bitch, it's twenty-two up in this clip of mine
My peoples lookin' up to me, so no, I can't be victimized
I got so much pent-up anger, I just wish a nigga tried
You gon' die before you blink, yeah, that's gon' be a quick demise
The world be so fucked up, that shit'll have you sick and tired
You can't even post a picture without being criticized
Was broke, but now I'm living everything I used to visualize
Thinking 'bout them stories, still don't make sense how my niggas died
That shit still haunt me to this day, them L's hurt a nigga pride
How both of the twins leave? Why one of them didn't survive?
Still want that point for Gucci, look his killer in his eyes
My bad I never scored for y'all, but at least a nigga tried
Walking through the opp shit with my Wesson, I couldn't get a ride
I gotta run through a check for every tear a nigga cried
Gon' make my mark up in this shit, make sure my spot solidified

Girl, you got me losin' my mind
I just want you to see that I'm trying
Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
Don't want to lose you in this race against time
Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
It's so hard to pay attention to the signs
Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
Broken hearts can make a grown man cry

I was sittin' there just thinkin', then reality, it hit me
Hope I feel your same pain when that bitch Karma come and get me
Feel like I don't deserve you no more, but I want you to be with me
We done built a bond so strong, and from that love, I know you miss me
Connected to your soul, I feel it when you hug and kiss me
Now your shoulder is so cold and lately, I been feelin' empty
I got caught up in this fame and all these hoes, I let it tempt me
In that hotel room alone, remember I would hold you gently
Went on dates, we took some pictures, everything was movin' quickly
Manipulated, I ain't think a new relationship would fit me
But I told you we can try it, even though I know it's risky
Mind games with our emotions, swear this shit get kinda tricky
Girl, you got me losin' my mind
I just want you to see that I'm trying
Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
Don't want to lose you in this race against time
Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
It's so hard to pay attention to the signs
Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
Broken hearts can make a grown man cry

Keep her in Love PINK 'cause I like how them joggers fit her
Wonderin' how I'ma play it, it was hard to get her
So beautiful, I keep her smilin' when I compliment her
If bein' this bad is a sin, I hope that God forgive her
Just had a son, I'm tryna be the perfect father figure
I kept you worried, in them trenches tryna dodge the killers
Tryna escape from this commitment made our problems bigger
It's hard to love with dysfunction, wish my scars was thinner
Tryna forgive me in your thoughts, I hope your heart remember
Know it's gon' hurt to see another nigga bondin' with her
Can't even look you in your eyes 'cause I'm burnin' up with guilt
For that one moment, went too far, and now I fucked up what we built

Girl, you got me losin' my mind
I just want you to see that I'm trying
Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
Don't want to lose you in this race against time
Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
It's so hard to pay attention to the signs

Don't give no fuck, the twins gone, and he wish he was with him
He say them niggas ain't been slidin' and his crown don't fit him
He want all them niggas dead, it's sad to say, but I feel him
If I ain't had so much to lose, I'd be riskin' it with him
Always rap about the guys 'cause I genuinely miss 'em
Five years later, thousand tears later, still feel like the day when they hit 'em
Make sure I always say y'all name so ain't no way they forget 'em

Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care

Let's just be friends before we rush into a label
Wanna know if you really fuck with me, girl, what's your angle?
It's only for the better if I'm tryna change you
Lovin' me ain't easy, if you leave, I don't blame you
Trauma got me fucked up, so I'm mentally unstable
I got wrapped up in my emotions, now I'm tangled
Deep in my thoughts and overthinkin' can get painful
Watch how I move, one wrong decision can be fatal
Hidden messages, conversations with my angels
Just walk with me and you'll see I'm tryna save you

Him against the world, 40 on him when he poppin' out
On his dark road, he just tryna find a proper route
Hate the criticism, he uses music to block it out
By his auntie, he was molested as a baby boy
Messed up his head, it even changed the way he play with toys
Up late night rappin' and they told him to quit makin' noise
Stuck in his feelings, he be spendin' every day annoyed
He wanna stand over a nigga, leave his face destroyed
He miss his hood, now this something that he can't avoid

I just picked a Cuban up from Wafi, bitch, these stones new

Bury me like a pharaoh with this money and my gold too
Keep a shooter in there, try to rob me, this the wrong tomb
I hit Johnny Dang and mixed the diamonds with the gold tooth
The FN sing a song like it's the leader of a soul group
Don't come 'round here like we friends, you know I don't know you
You know I got demons, allow me to show you
Lately, I been on the road (Yeah), show after show
I know I'm makin' all the opps mad back home
Been a while since I had to dial from a trap phone
See you later, alligator, quite a while, crocodile, we gone
Pray to God that my money stay long
Also prayin' for good aim for when the devil try to go

Natural born hustler, nigga, stuntin' is my strong suit
Flexin' with a hundred cash, look at what these songs do
Gangster and a baller, baby, I do what I want to
I be with some steppers, I don't care 'bout what you gon' do
Wet shit like the Warriors, all my niggas gon' shoot
He gon' have to take a loss, some my niggas gone too

That broke shit made me sick, big appetite with a weak stomach
Ain't had nowhere to go, nigga, I was lost in them streets runnin'
And I hit Rodeo just to get stylish, ran through three hundred
Just happy I did it, nigga, nobody ever gave me nothin'
Flexin' so hard I might pull a muscle, but I just keep stuntin'
Thirty in the mag, you get body-bagged, I'm just gon' keep dumpin'
Police get behind me, I'ma press the gas, I'm just gon' keep stompin'
I'm just gon' keep stompin'

Plottin on the come-up, we was schemin'
Now I hit the stage and they screamin'
I was tryna cope through them hard times
For them X pills, I was fiendin'
Got a bad bitch, honey skintone, pretty long hair, she Belizean
Tryna tell you, girl, I can't love you, I'm a cold-hearted lil' demon
Dysfunctional, I can't show affection, might bug out for no reason
Really you don't even gotta be here, I done got so used to people leavin'
You was ridin' for me, then you switched up, now it's fuck you and I mean it
Couple situations left me traumatized, now I say less 'cause I'm speechless
If my brother need it, then I got him, man, the whole gang know how I'm bleedin'
Tryna wake up from them nightmares, devil in my ear while I'm dreamin'
In my past life, did some bad things, I know karma tryna get even
Tryna get away from all the drama, hopped in the Benz, now I'm speedin'
Told 'em I was gonna be somethin'
That broke shit made me sick, big appetite with a weak stomach
Ain't had nowhere to go, nigga, I was lost in them streets runnin'

I'm just gon' keep stompin'

Goofy tried stealin' my formula
Look, these niggas corny, these niggas can't come on my corner
I'm the one do what I wanna
I made the guys spin that bitch every day like a carnival
Bought her a Patek Philippe 'cause she wanted one
These niggas nothin' like me, I am one of one
Take the Bentley, four hundred, I pay the bond
You ain't scarin' no one with no gun in this bitch
Everybody go dumb in this bitch
Niggas hoes and they mama a bitch
In the hood like Obama and shit
Presidential tint, no tellin' who in it
Ask around, I bet they tell you we winnin'
Different foreign cars, ain't none of 'em rented
Hundred million cash, I'm comin' to get it
Out in Cali', but my mind in the trenches
I advise the boy to play his position
Run it up and show love to my city
Never leave 'em, I'm bringin' 'em with me
Keep a glizzy, it's goin' in with me, I can't let 'em get me
No time for bullshit, I'm sorry, I'm busy
I'ma go hard 'til I'm forty or fifty
Niggas be talkin', but they never do shit
So if it ain't money, I don't even listen
Told 'em I was gonna be somethin'

Iceberg want a bag, bitch

We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain

It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

I call lil' bro, he said he ready for the stain (Said he ready for the stain)
What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today (Back today)

Lil' Capalot, bitch, hah
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

Hit the strip after school, couldn't wait 'til I got out of class, used to stare at the clock and shit
Before all of this rappin' shit, I was gangbangin' and doin' high-speeds on the cops and shit
And I'm straight from the Chi, but I ball like a king up in Cali and shoot like Stojaković
Keep applyin' that pressure, I go on the run, it ain't no lettin' it up, ain't no stoppin' this
Had to tell my lil' brother to chill, gotta stay in the house, come outside, he be poppin' shit
You ain't heard about us, well, you need to go watch the news, niggas know we be dropping shit
Got the feds on my ass in the hood 'cause they think I'm the one who been buyin' up Glocks and shit
I'm just focused on music, they say my last tape was a classic, but I got some hotter shit (Hotter shit)
Might be rocking a show or if I'm not up the stu', then I'm fucking this cash off
Don't you know Polo G? Skinny tall with the dreads, that lil' nigga be rappin' his ass off
Yeah, I heard she got surgery, still wanna clap from the back just to see if her ass soft
Go like Harden with rockets, we blast off
Tried to throw us some bullets, but we made 'em fumble, like nah, you ain't gettin' that pass off
Spin the block, now I'm takin' my mask off
Hit the gas like we racin', speed off in them foreigns and leave tire marks on the asphalt
It's gon' be R.I.P. once your ass caught
He like frontin', we knockin' his cap off
'Nother day, a new chain or a MAC bought
All this ice got me freezin' like Jack Frost (4X)
That boy a bitch, that's his dad fault
If you play, then you lay, we can crash out (Let's go)
When I up in his shit, bet it's man down (Boom)
In BOA, I'm pullin' them bands out (Cash)
DOA, bitch, I get your mans off (Gone)
A rockstar from the block, I stand out (Uh)
Came from nothing, I fucked my advance off
When I hit the game, with my flow, niggas ran off (No cap), fuck it
I'm not your average joe (Uh-uh)
When I leave the house, I tuck it, uh (Fire, fire)
I'm rich, I don't shop on no budget
He clutchin', my lil' youngin want him a bucket, uh (Score)
I hop on this bitch and run it (Uh)
If I said it, I seen it or done it (Uh, uh)
These lil' niggas never robbed nobody
Ain't caught no body, and ain't getting no money (Cap)
Where I'm from, it's sports or gunplay
We looked up to the killer and dealers
But even them niggas wan' make it out one day (On gang)
Fuck my first M, I been had hood fame (Yeah)
Took off like I was on a runway (Yoom)
I'm a star, but still post on the one way (Blatt)
Them niggas talk, but they won't play (NLE)
We let them guns sing like the choir on Sunday (Yeah, yeah)
Hop on the scene and I'm thuggin'
This Glock on my hip, so you know that I'm clutchin'
Catch me an opp, I'ma down him in public
The police keep askin', I'm changin' the subject
The way I grew up, man, a nigga was rugged
Why the fuck you got a gun? You not gonna bust it
And a hundred some shots, I ain't doin' no tustlin'
Give a nigga temptation like he David Ruffin
I ain't gon' cap, I don't even like rappin'
But I love wrappin' them bodies and shit
Fuck the bitch, and when I get done
I'ma up my Glock and then rob the bitch
Catch a nigga when he clock out
I'ma get him whacked at his job and shit
And I don't know why the police keep fuckin' with me
'Cause they ain't stoppin' shit, yeah
Spin on your block like a remix
Shoot him in the face, get his teeth lit
Extended clip like a broomstick
Shoot a flick like Netflix
Scratch an opp off the checklist
I just bought a gun off Craigslist
Shoot an opp in the brain, I'm leavin' a stain, only thing you see is red shit
If the police behind, we keep duckin'
My gun need some drawers, it got nuts
Whole gang, we strapped, don't test us
If a nigga play, he gon' get bust, yeah

Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Да, да, да, да

Я сказал ей, ""Уух-вуу-вуу""
Шоути хочет трахнуть меня внутри купе
Я могу вывезти тебя хоть куда, нахуй реактивный тариф
Отель Versace на мне Versace халат, воу, воу
Люблю тебя, когда ты распускаешь свои волосы без расчёски
И  я остаюсь для себя, потому что я никогда не любил этих шлюх (Да)
И она любит только деньги, красный свет этим шлюхам
Почему я должен тратить своё время на шоути, у которой я не на переднем плане?
Особенно, когда ты получаешь дизайнерскую одежду и я пою вином и угощаю обедом
И Bentley пришёл с крыльями, как номер девять, да
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу

Да, да, да, да

Это мой тип сук, она говорит немного дерьма
Как, ""Когда ты полетишь ко мне наедине, могу я приземлиться на этот член?""
Она сказала, ""Трюки для детей"", она не влюбляется в трюки
Она может обращаться с собой самостоятельно, ей просто нужен член
Получил эту большую Birkin сумку стоимостью пять, шесть чисел
Ты может был не в своей лиге, ты можешь купить это, нигга? (Купи это)
Я подхожу к её вершине ухожу на рассвете, я дон
Ты можешь валять дурака, если хочешь, если хочешь
На Бали, большие качели, большое платье
Большая жопа, заставляю её сквиртить и делать большую грязь
До того, как мы закончили, она спросила ""Где мы займёмся этим в следующий раз?""
Дальше, так мокро, что испортили сиденья в самолёте
Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо
Сверху вниз, катаюсь вокруг со стволом
С кем ты?Вуу
Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо
Я сказал, ""Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо""

Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу

Позволь мне взять тебя в магазин сладостей (Магазин сладостей)
Покажу тебе всё, что у меня есть (Всё, что у меня есть, всё, что у меня есть)
Повешу бриллианты на твою цепь (Цепь, ах)
Чтобы соответствовать твоему бриллиантовому кольцу (Ах, ах, ах)
Я 092, нигга, Вуу (Вуу, назад)
Ненавидишь это или любишь это (Ах, ах), это мы с тобой (Вуу)
Давай превратим её во что-то
Она сказала, что любит Вуу ниггеров (Вуу, ах)
Тех ниггеров, которые нажмут на курок (Гррт, ох, не, не, не)
Я был в порядке, когда встретил тебя (Встретил тебя, пау)
Затем я трахнул тебя (Вуу)
Затем я оставил тебя (Ах)
Потому что твоя киска чувствовала себя безумной (Безумной, чувствовала безумной)
И у меня не было времени, которое можно потратить (Нет времени, которое можно потратить, давай получим это)

Zamykam oczy kiedy śpię, mam nadzieję że będziesz tam kiedy się obudzę
Szczerze mówiąc, czuję że atmosfera którą mamy jest świetna
I jeśli masz cos na myśli, możesz mi powiedzieć
I jeśli powiedział by mi co jest na mojej, czy pomogłabyś mi?
Zobaczysz większy obraz, to po prostu zajmie trochę czasu
Tylko dlatego że jesteś moja, sprawię, że będziesz wyglądać jak diament
Nie ma żadnych niedoskonałości, dziewczyno, jesteś niezła
Kochanie, jaki jest twój znak?
Mam nadzieje że nie jesteś wolna gdy pracujesz
(Praca, praca, to ja i ty) Ja i ty
Bądź cicho, teraz nie ma niczego czego nie możemy zrobić
Przez storm, kochanie, my możemy przez to przejść
Dlaczego zachowujesz się jak nowa? Wiesz że jesteś moją laską, tak
Wstałem na mojego Birkina, to działa
Powiedziała, że jest dziewicą (to boli)
Jest moim największym fanem, ona zawsze jest przyczajona
I wie że jestem mężczyzną, ja na to zapracuję
Wiem, że mnie nie znosi, jestem luksusowy
Więc przyprowadzę ją, kiedy dostanę Grammy
Seks późną nocą, nie może znaleźć swoich majtek
Nie mogła tego wstrzymać, teraz ona potrzebuje planu B
Laska jest niegrzeczna
Laska jest teraz ze mną
I laska ma grubą dupę (Laska ma grubą dupę)
Laska łapie wahania nastroju
Za każdym razem gdy rucham bez gumki
To spuściłem się na pościel
I trzymałem to pod przykrywką
Bo ja nie całuje i opowiadamEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Polskie-tumaczenia-genius-pop-smoke-mood-swings-ft-lil-tjay-polskie-tumaczenie-lyrics,2020-07-18

Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day

In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades

But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder

I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me

Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Maldición)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Uh)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

Decían que no llegaría tan lejos, ah, ah
¿Piensan que no vemos quiénes son, son, son?
Riendo al banco como ja, ja, ja
Supongo que solo estoy hablando mucho, bla, bla, bla  (Cállate la puta boca)
Entonces, ¿a dónde fueron? (Uh)
Cuando estaba en bancarrota no podía ni comprar cigarrillos
Ahora tu mamá necesita boletos para mi concierto en el estadio (Concierto en el estado)
A ella le encanta cuando me escucha en la radio, oh
Sé que es difícil tragarse su orgullo
Me disculpo porque no puedes superarme (Superarme)
Ahora estás fuera de mi vida, estoy tan aliviado, yo

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Uh)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste
A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

Cerca de mis enemigos (Vamos)
Necesito mejor energía (¿Eh?)
Cuando te dije que te jodieras, pensaste que estaba jugando, ¿eh?
(Sí, sí) Pero lo decía literal
Ella quiere quedar, le dije a la mierda eso (No)
Ella me mira como si estuviera sorprendida
Empaquetan el correo y estoy solo en casa
Cuando la caja toca la puerta, van por 35
Trato de poner de mi parte para mis compañeros, se convierten en enemigos antes de que el ojo de un negro lo haga
Alcanzas un batido, voy a sostener un puño
Dándole a un negro un cuarto de libra sin las papas fritas
Acabo de conseguir doble platino sin colaboraciones
Sólo para mostrarle a un negro que en realidad no lo necesito
Pásale a un hombre un plato y puede hacerlo temblar
Está garantizado que se doblará y morderá la mano que lo alimenta
Y sé que piensas que no lo veo
Y sé que tu perra no tiene auto
Me estás obligando a que vaya y le compre un pequeño Prius
Follemos frente a la cámara, podemos llamarlo incluso
Los amigos son como el otoño, cada año se van
Y voy a rastrillarlos en una pila, tirarlos en una bolsa
Atarlos junto a sus perras y dejarlos
Porque la mayoría de estos negros son engañosos
Y yo (Uh)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Uh)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

Es demasiado tarde para cambiar esta mierda (Demasiado tarde)
Solo me sostuviste cuando querías que me ahogara
Es demasiado tarde para cambiar esta mierda (Demasiado tarde)
Así que no intentes decirme que estás feliz por mí ahora

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí
(Muertos para mí)
El dinero tiende a mostrar todas sus intenciones (Intenciones)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)

Sí, tú morirías por mí
Dijiste que morirías, dijiste que morirías
Pero mentiste, pero mentiste

Dijiste que te llevarías una bala y morirías por mí
Tengo un mal presentimiento de que me has estado mintiendo
En lo más bajo, pero hemos estado drogándonos
Cuando pasa de las 11 veo un lado diferente
Dijiste que morirías por mí, morirías por mí, morirías por mí
Pero me mentiste, me mentiste, me mentiste
Dijiste que morirías por mí, morirías por mí, morirías por mí
Pero me mentiste, me mentiste, me mentiste

Fue amor a primera vista, como si fueses la elegida (Oh)
Pero sé que las venas en tu brazo están congeladas (Congeladas)
No tengo más paciencia (No)
He esperado mucho (Sí)
Escondiste tu mierda, y fui el último en saberlo, perra (Ey)
Medio dormido, a lo lejos te escuché llegar
No sabía que eras tú y saqué la pistola de la caja fuerte (Maldición)
Recuerdo cuando hiciste que me arrestaran (Guau)
Al menos dentro de prisión tenía un poco de paz (Sí)
Uh, me rindo (Ey), es tiempo de olvidarte (Ey)
Estoy demasiado cansado para perdonarte (Ey), es demasiado para mi hígado (Ey)
Y sabes (Ey) que todo (Ey) ha terminado
Todos tus amigos (Ey), sabes que (Ey) te traicionaron

Dijiste que te llevarías una bala y morirías por mí (Morirías por mí)
Tengo un mal presentimiento de que me has estado mintiendo (Mintiendo)
En lo más bajo, pero hemos estado drogándonos (Drogándonos)
Cuando pasa de las 11 veo un lado diferente (Veo un lado)
Dijiste que morirías por mí, morirías por mí, morirías por mí (Morirías, morirías, morirías)
Pero me mentiste, me mentiste, me mentiste (Mentiste, mentiste, mentiste)
Dijiste que morirías por mí, morirías por mí, morirías por mí (Morirías, morirías, morirías)
Pero me mentiste, me mentiste, me mentiste (Mentiste, sí)

Fue en un VIP, resultó ser una de mis mejores noches
A las 9 AM llegué del club, era de día (De día)
Tenía una chica mala, la estaba tratando demasiado bien (La estaba tratando demasiado bien)
Te atrapé siendo vulnerable, eso no es lo que necesito (No es lo que necesito)
Vendiste tu alma, chica, deja de llorar (Vendiste tu alma)
Tu pasaporte, parece que estás mintiendo (Sabía que eras fría)
Estás destrozada por tu pasado, no lo niegues (Sabes que lo sé)
Tu ex llamó, estabas vulnerable, estabas volando, nah (Volando)
No fue en los mejores términos, chica, estaba probando (Te estaba probando)
Hice todo para contactarte (Para contactarte)
Dijiste que nunca me habías atrapado en ningún drama (Ningún drama)
Me cansé de correr hacia mi karma (Me cansé de correr)
Dijiste que te llevarías una bala y morirías por mí (Que morirías)
Tengo un mal presentimiento de que me has estado mintiendo (Has estado mintiendo)
En lo más bajo, pero hemos estado drogándonos (Estabas drogada)
Cuando pasa de las 11 veo un lado diferente (Un lado diferente)
Dijiste que morirías por mí, morirías por mí, morirías por mí (Dijiste que morirías, morirías, morirías)
Pero me mentiste, me mentiste, me mentiste (Ahora mientes)
Dijiste que morirías por mí, morirías por mí, morirías por mí (Oh sí, oh sí, oh sí)
Pero me mentiste, me mentiste, me mentiste

Tranquilízate, te lo explico, es bastante simple
Llegué, me di cuenta, debí haber seguido mi instinto
Ya no estoy jugando, miré tu teléfono
Y vis las chicas en tus MDs y las llevé a todas a casa
Y sé que ha pasado un tiempo desde la última vez que escuchaste sobre mí
Crecí siendo salvaje y por eso me dieron este verso a mí
Voy a los shows porque ellos van a los shows
Vendí 15 millones de copias de una carta de ruptura
Traje a un par de extraños a nuestra cama
Y ahora perdiste tu derecho a la privacidad
Contando todos nuestros secretos
Cuando pensaste que probablemente morirían conmigo
Sé que te encanta por lo bajo
Y no tienes que decir que estoy loca
Porque sé que nada ha cambiado
Dijiste que te llevarías una bala y morirías por mí
(Morirías, morirías, morirías)
Tengo un mal presentimiento de que me has estado mintiendo
(Pero mentiste, mentiste, mentiste)
En lo más bajo, pero hemos estado drogándonos

Cuando pasa de las 11 veo un lado diferente

I got so many hits, can’t remember them all (Ooh)
While I'm takin’ a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain’t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah
'Cause they ain't ever seen me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never

When it was time to do some work and put it in (Put it in)
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them (Ha)
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win (Uh)
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never

'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I

Wykrwawiłaś mnie do sucha, tak jak łzy, których nie ukazujesz
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść

Nigdy niczego nie potrzebowałem od Ciebie
I wszystko, o co zapytałem było dla prawdy (Wszystko, o co zapytałem było)
Pokazałaś swój język, był w parze rozwidlony
Twój jad był śmiertelny, prawie tobie uwierzyłem (Prawie tobie uwierzyłem)
Tak, żerowałaś na każdym moim błędzie
Czekałaś na mnie, powstrzymywałaś mnie od wierzenia, że utonę
Marnowałem siebie, jak plagę
Próbuję szukać swojej drogi do wyjścia, szukać swojej drogi do wyjścia (Szukać swojej drogi do wyjścia)

I nareszcie przyszedł ten dzień
Zacząłem oddawać swoje serce
Na litość boską, kości mi się złamią
Ale nigdy nie nabędziesz mojej duszy, nie-e
Czuję, jak kruszysz się w mych rękach, aż do twego serca z kamienia
Wykrwawiłaś mnie do sucha, tak jak łzy, których nie ukazujesz
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść

Wziąłem kamienie, którymi rzucałaś, zrobiłem łańcuchy dla ekipy (Lód)
Wziąłem ze sobą dziesięć dziwek, ta fura była stworzona dla dwóch (Tak, panie)
Przebiegały przez nią, nic nie pozostało do zrobienia
Potrzebuję więcej powodów, aby żyć tego wieczoru (Prosto w górę!)
Ja piłem na zawsze i brałem cokolwiek
Wierzyłem o myśleniu, że ty kiedyś wrócisz
Pójdźmy naszymi własnymi drogami, którąkolwiek
Mówisz, że jak, to jakkolwiek długo
Bo wiesz, że ja nigdy nie będę sam (Tak)

Miłość (Miłość, tak)
Laska będzie się ruszać (Laska będzie, laska będzie się ruszać)
Potrzebuję tego na widoku (Potrzebuję tego na, potrzebuję tego na widoku)
Zepsuj to wszystko (Zepsuj to, zepsuj to wszystko)
Daj jej tą lufkę (Daj jej tą, daj jej tą lufkę)
Cały mój gang (Cały mój, cały mój gang)
Laska stała się zła (Laska stała się, laska stała się zła)
Czuję, jak kruszysz się w mych rękach, aż do twego serca z kamienia
Wykrwawiłaś mnie do sucha, tak jak łzy, których nie ukazujesz
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść

I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)
I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head

I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite songs, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close

1029,3138,Rick Ross Featuring Drake,Rick Ross,Gold Roses,3,39,"Yeah
I'm home now, it's over now, so...
Yeah

She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
""I gotta get the most of everything"" is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late
This different right here, yo

I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)
(Maybach Music)
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (Stop talkin', stop talkin')
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Rick-ross-gold-roses-lyrics,2019-08-10

I wish Sunday's on a creek bank would never end
Wish I could learn to drive again
Wish the first time, seventeen, she was my everything kiss in a Chevrolet could happen every day

They say livin' that life on the road won't get you very far
I say man you should've been down in Tupelo
Seen what was in the front row

There was this girl, beer in her hand

Took six months on a farm 'fore I saved up

Wonderin' why I ever settled down

But there was this girl, holdin' my hand

That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

(LC)

It was trials and tribulations on the road to chasing that paper
Seen so many faces, been so many places, caught some cases
Crazy thing is, out of all life done taught me
Before you get one win, you gotta take a thousand losses
I remember, nigga, yeah (Straight up, you know me)
How would I ever forget? How could I ever forget? (Yeah, yeah)
I remember, oh, I remember
How could I ever forget? How would I ever forget?

I remember everything, the shine and the struggle
I remember all the pain, all the grind, all the hustle
I remember elementary when pops would come and get me
And take me to the neighborhood with Valerria and Whitney
Then pops had went to prison, I remember every letter
I remember bitches playing with my heart 'cause I would let 'em
I remember what's-his-name told me, ""Bro, let's stick together""
But we couldn't stick together 'cause niggas change just like the weather
I still remember the first night when I met Mr. Raymond
I was on the block with Glocks when Uncle Dereck came to save me
Remember back in middle school when I met Derek Bailey
And he taught me how to sack that weed, stack that cheese, and save it
But I still fucked it up, I remember tryna shake back
Me and Sir Kendrick in the kitchen cookin' fake crack
I remember my first show, I remember who booked me
I remember all you opps from middle school, them niggas was pussy
I remember my first stolen car, I was with Lil Chaz
I had just jumped off the porch, but lil' bruh was moving fast
I remember when I first met Kareem, we was coolin'
A year later, we was breakin' in them houses, shootin' movies
If we catch a nigga late night, no pipe, it's a wrap
We made lil' what's-his-name jump off his bike and that's a fact
Remember when I first caught a buzz with my raps
Money came and niggas changed and stabbed me in my back
Remember when I first confessed my love and I cried
Asked you 'bout that other fuck nigga and you lied
No longer could I stand to see the truth in your eyes
So I went somewhere else to find love and you know why
Remember sitting in my cell blaming the streets
Mama came to see me, said the blame was on me
Remember Lenny died, the city cried for a week
I remember when you niggas testified on Lil C
It was trials and tribulations on the road to chasing that paper (I remember, I remember, nigga)
Seen so many faces, been so many places, caught some cases
Crazy thing is, out of all life done taught me
Before you get one win, you gotta take a thousand losses
I remember, nigga, yeah
How would I ever forget? How could I ever forget?
I remember, oh, I remember
How could I ever forget? How would I ever forget?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Rod-wave-i-remember-lyrics,2020-04-18

Right now, I'm riding through Memphis, passing through the city
I'm with my niggas, but I miss you, girl, don't get it twisted
And I cannot wait 'til I see you, hug you, and kiss you
Remember when I had first met you how I used to sweat you
I used to call your phone and text you and tell you you're special
Like girl, you're special, you the kinda girl that I need
I actually made you mine, sometimes, I can't believe
Wonder what your nigga was thinking when he let you leave
You try to leave, I might get down on my hands and knees
I'm still a G, please believe, but girl, you make me weak
You make me feel something I never felt, the reason I never left
A lot of hoes want your position, but they tripping
You been with me since the beginning and that's the way I'ma end it
But just in case you feel you cannot stay, babe
Cars, clothes, and hoes, I'd trade it all
For a guaranteed spot in your heart

This shit rough, man
You got a long road, boy, a cold one
Straight up
Only love what you do for 'em
The only kinda love out here, my nigga

Who can you trust in this cold, cold world? Better get a blanket
It's worse than the wild, wild west, this shit get dangerous
Never thought I'd see the day separate glitter from gold
When friends turn into foes, but it's the life that I chose
And these hoes look so heaven-sent, but be so devilish
Got spiteful ways, never seen it coming like a tidal wave
Get on my knees every day, I asked God and prayed
That my dirty ways don't lead me to an early grave
One life to live and it's survival of the fuckin' fittest
Here come your rivals, when you winnin', they want competition
And did I mention niggas itchin' to be opposition?
Hit they blocks with Glocks with the extensions, now ain't no tension
Told my old lady how I'm feelin', she say I'm trippin'
But she don't know I pray for love
On the block with the thugs
Prayin' a nigga show us love, but ain't no love, so we get it out the mud
Mama made me feel like I overstayed my welcome
So I packed up my shit and went for seldom, like where's the fellas?
I'm pretty sure they understand the way I feel
Hotbox the bucket, laugh about how cold the world is
Like ain't no love in this shit 'til you get rich and famous
And these hoes want rappers or ball players
It's hard to separate the fake, 'cause they chose us
Everybody showed up when we blowed up

Ain't no trust in a nigga after this

I heard he feed his problem to the vultures
He couldn't take no more so he exploded

Young nigga from the bottom of the map
Came up riding with the strap, iron on his lap
One false move, get whacked
Got the whole hood on his back
And it's just like that
For my niggas trapped in the trap
Pray to God we all make it back, pray we all make it back
Gotta pray we all make it back
And I know it's raw that I rap
But a street nigga first
Tell the crackers free Mac Deezy
Ma, look at your son, I'm on TV
They didn't believe me
Nigga went and got it off the greezy
It's hard, but I make it look easy, a crazy achievement
Won't really fuck with no rappers
All these niggas hustling backwards
Misguiding  the youth
But long as I know the truth
That's another subject for after
And I'm riding in the Rover
12 keep on trying to pull me over
Asking a nigga if I stole it, I bought it, I own it
I remember walking to school
Catching the bus early morning, like, Ma, I ain't going
I was in the hallways roaming
But I still got my diploma, I got my diploma
Went to school all twelve years just to get a job selling donuts, man, that's crazy
I ain't with the minimum waging
I ain't with the modern day slavery
The fuck is you saying?
Told the crackers, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Had to tell 'em, ""Fuck you, pay me""
It's back to the block
Well, I guess it's back to the block
In the streets running 'round playing hooky (Hooky)
And I ain't never sold no crack, but I'm so street, I can cook it
And I know it's hard to find a way
But you're bound to see brighter days
A million dollars can't change me, nigga
'Cause hard times made me, nigga
A hard grind saved me, nigga
I got it off the pavement, nigga
I got it off the pavement, my nigga

Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta
Cold-hearted nigga, with the blocka-blocka
Gotta keep it on me, I don't wanna die young
I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?

Tryna get my bag, I had to go and make it happen
Me and my dogs, we was bussin' out them bandos
Count out them hunnids, then we throw it in the mattress
Wrap it in plastic, and throw it in the attic
I be in the streets, nigga, I stand ten toes
Any nigga in my situation would've been fold
We was trappin' out the basement, made it back tenfold
Gotta stay out the way, that's why I'm always behind the tint for
We was fightin' fed cases, 'member I was 2 and 0
Nigga was fightin' depression, sippin' syrup, I was movin' slow
I was down below, but still, I always kept my head up
Nigga gotta get my bread up, I don't wanna die young
No, no, no

I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta
Cold-hearted nigga, with the blocka-blocka

Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Red sun melting to the blacktop
Dollar shades from a nowhere truck stop
Your kiss and that coastline
If heaven is anywhere
Pull it over to the shoulder
To take it in
And pull you closer
Loving you longer than I ever did
Going places we never been
'Cause heaven's in

A blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here

Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya
If heaven is anywhere
It's in a blue Tacoma, California

Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
Rays of gold are shining on ya

Huh, yeah

My baby, she's Alabama
A dixie land delight, kissin' me like molasses
Slow and sweet, mhm, just right
She's an endless August summer, yeah, sunshine 3-6-5
When she forgets the punch line, it still gets me every time

'Cause I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love

Yeah, she's Seattle and Sonoma
Runs on coffee and red wine
She's easy like Sunday morning and wild like Saturday night
She's 24-carat goodness, an angel's all I see
She dresses up for everything, but she only dress down for me

And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Yeah! Who! Come on!
Woah, hey!
My baby, she's Alabama
My Dixie Land delight
She's everybody's dream girl, but she's all mine

And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does

1059,8990,Russell Dickerson,Russell Dickerson,Love You Like I Used To,16,31,"Girl, I’ve always loved you, oh, but something’s changed
Blame it on time, the road or the ride, but it ain't the same
It’s a different kind of feeling, not the one I knew
From the sweet on your lips, to how your hand in mine fits
Girl, I've always loved you, but

I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I'm with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby, I do, I don't love you like I used to, no

What we got ain't got no ending, like a band of solid gold
It’s sweeter with time like strawberry wine, it gets as good as it gets old
And oh, we thought we knew what it meant way back then
Oh, but I keep fallin' all in higher than I've ever been, oh no, oh

I don't love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I'm with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn't know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby, I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

Oh no, no-no

I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

Roses
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell her girl you cute but balling
That shit gorgeous
Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who the god is
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw

I might bring them Brooklyn niggas out, oh lord it's overs
I might bring them strippers out and tell 'em do it pole-less
You already know, already know, nigga roses
Kill 'em, make it ...

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees, spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me

Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved (So loved)

I've been havin' dreams
Splashin' in the summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin' weight of paradise
Solid block of gold, lyin' in the cold
I feel right at home
Wait, if I'm on fire

I was into you from the beginning even if you wasn't mine
Scared to admit my shortcomings led to overdraft in this affair, declining
Quicker than we started, evidence we misaligned
Man, I get more in love (More in love) with you each argument
Somethin' wrong with me, I like the way you screw your face up
Trigger me right when I need it
You wrong, but I can't get along without you
It's a shame and I can't blame myself, keep on lovin' you
You do it different
All that I know is
Mirrors inside me
They recognize you

Don't trip when you see me out, kickin' with my new bitch
I'll still hang around even though you cappin', cappin'
I could pretend you was my main nigga
Bet you love just how that feels (Oh, shit)
Out of my way, you out of pocket, need clear vision, boy (Vision)
Can't trust decision when you near me
Get myself caught in your crossfire
You a wild one, and I'm wading in you like it's cool water
Like it's cool when you pull up boo'd up with a new and it's not me

With the winter wolves, in the dark, alone
The wildest night, I became the one
And you'll know you're mine when the silence comes

Heavy is the crown only for the weak

A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down
'Cause power is power, my fire never goes out
I rise from my scars, nothing hurts me now
'Cause power is power
Now watch me burn it down

I been down with the coldest war
And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Feelings of emptiness
Only love could kill me, God bless
A knife in my heart
Couldn't slow me down (Couldn't slow me down)
'Cause power is power ('Cause power is power)
My fire never goes out
I rise from my scars
Nothing hurts me now (Nothing hurts me now)
'Cause power is power ('Cause power is power)
Now watch me burn it down

Breathe, feel the air that I breathe (Yeah)
Air that I, air that I breathe
Who's hotter? Been a monster with a crown
So swamped by high water, keep your head up, you might drown
In this world, it's way colder, by the day, we count it down
Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase
I took a lot, so I took it back (Do-do-do-do-do, yeah)
Danger's on my mind
Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it
'Fore you, yeah, you know, I go right straight through it, yeah

Heavy is the crown, but never for a queen (Oh yeah)

It couldn't slow me down (Couldn't slow me down)

Ooh, ass fat, I had to buy it
Ain't a nigga alive that's gon' deny it
This nigga makin' me feel erotic (Erotic)
Uh, he a freak like Giannis (Giannis)
To be honest, I hope one day we do a play-date with Adonis
Ooh, I'm 'bout my cake, get your bakin' on
You don't want that real smoke, get your vapin' on
Egg whites, turkey bacon on
Ain't in a restaurant, but I'm the bitch they been waitin' on (Tag) Gotta pop tags, bitches stuntin' in them hand-me-down bags
It's sad, Burberry plaid, you in that drip that I already had

They wanna see you do your dance
Do that thing pokе out them pants?
If it don't, then I got plans
Bam, just got a summertimе tan
Scram, we're just puttin' dollars on your head
Niggas violatin' the gang gon' end up dead
Lady in the street, but a freak ho in the bed
Chopper on him, that's my shooter in the red
Lil' nigga can't keep my pussy out his hands
Fuck a last minute, gotta book me in advance
Been a bad girl and I'm tryna get spanked
Pretty little body, but my face look stank
I be in a truck that cost your whole house
Bitches imitate me but don't come close
If you wanna celebrate the best, then come toast
Bitches ain't sayin' nothin', but doin' the utmost
Heard he wanna chew on my edible panties
Even when I tell him, ""See you tomorrow,"" he can't leave
Got the Off-White sneakers, rockin' a tan weave
When I come out, grab Simba, it's a stampede

Ooh, lil' bitch wan' ride it
Told the bitch don't get out her body
Hmm, get right beside me
I'ma get in that thang, get to slidin'
This bitch makin' me feel erotic
Huh, she gotta get on this rocket
I don't give a fuck 'bout her milage
And her grandmom related to the Winans
Ooh, that's the shit that I like
You a church girl, bitch, you like Christ
Hmm, you ain't never had pipe
Least not this kind, I'ma fuck you all night
Off a Perc', hmm, off a Perc' pack
Yeah, leave a bitch with the hurt back
Go to work, hmm, where the work at?
My young niggas wakin' up to serve that
They wanna see me do my dance
In these thousand-dollar pants
Don't disrespect me and my mans
Bang, whole lotta choppers on your ass

Scram, we just put them dollars on your head
Snitchin'-ass nigga gave his mama to the feds
Little brother, big brother, Sada got the dreads
DZ, DT, Sada keep the bands
Lil' bitch can't keep her pussy out my hands
Got a real Hood Rat Suki on my hands
I was stackin' blues, run up Tookies on they ass
I be in the Bay rollin' Cookies on they ass
I be in the 'Nellas, G Weed gave me his blessing
'Cause Sada can't be jealous off weed, I'm never stressin'
I can see the booty from the bottom, that thang a double decker
Let my white boy shoot on that thing, he Sam Dekker
Heard you used to chew on that thing, Hannibal Lecter
Have you poppin' all of them pills like Heath Ledger
These drugs ain't a joke, my nigga, I'm just tellin' you
Your manager got you on the shelf and he sellin' you

They wanna see me do my dance

Ayy
I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet

Ain't it funny how I can't seem
To get away from you?

1073,3266,Sarah Jeffery,Sarah Jeffery,Queen Of Mean,8,49,"I'm so tired of pretending
Where's my happy ending?

I followed all the rules
I drew inside the lines
I never asked for anything that wasn't mine
I waited patiently for my time
But when it finally came
He called her name
And now I feel this overwhelming pain
I mean it's in my veins
I mean it's in my brain
My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train
I'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame
I know exactly who to blame

I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And it's calling me the queen
Being nice was my pastime
But I've been hurt for the last time
And I won't ever let another person take advantage of me
The anger burns my skin, third-degree
Now my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea
There's nobody getting close to me
They're gonna bow to the Evil Queen
Your nightmare's my dream
Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes

I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean

Something's pulling me
It's so magnetic
My body is moving
Unsure where I'm headed
All of my senses have left me defenseless
This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance
The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive
There's nothing to lose
When you're lonely and friendless
So my only interest is showing this princess
That I am the queen
And my reign will be endless (Endless)
I want what I deserve
I want to rule the world
Sit back and watch them learn
It's finally my turn

If they want a villain for a queen
I'm gonna be one like they've never seen
I'll show them what it means
Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad
'Cause the devil's on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)

Ahora quiere que la grabe (Prr)
Vacilando y que se la enseñen a él (Dile)
Ya no le gusta seguir patrone', ella e' la patrona (Ey)
Se te fue la princecita, búscate a Fiona, porque
To' los fine' de semana está de party en party (Wuh)
Sigue matando las gana' con botella y mari
Te dejaron un estado ahí, ahí, ahí
Dice ""me sigue tirando y no caí ahí, ahí"" (¿Qué, qué?)
Incumpliste el contrato, yo puse lo que faltaba
A ella le gusta el maltrato, pero no el que tú le daba' (Ah)
Le dicen la Apple, tiene su iPhone, su iPa' perrear (Eh, eh)
IPa' beber, iPa' fumar, iPa' joder, ¿qué? (Ah, ah)
To' los fine' de semana está de party en party
Sigue matando las gana' con botella y mari (Let's go)
Te dejaron un estado ahí, ahí, ahí
Dedica'o pa' ti, decía así: (Welcome to the remix)

¿Tú te ha' creído que te iba a llorar? (Uhm)
Tú la lleva' clara que te iba a espera' (No)
Tú te pensaste que tú me tenía'
Pero nunca me tuviste, soy La Rosalía (Mira)
Si llevo tanta' cadena' no e' pa' que nadie me amarre (Nah)
No deja' que nadie a mí el cora me desgarre
Tú 'tá jugando con la jugadora
La que pisa fuerte, la mata'ora
Ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella
Mari y una botella
Gracia' al maltrato se puso bella
Ahora tú la quiere' y no te quiere ella
Y ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella (A ella)
Mari y una botella (Oh)
Gracias al maltrato se puso bella (Yah)
Ahora tú la quiere' y no te quiere ella (Nah, nah; huh)

Todo empezó con el bloqueo de WhatsApp
Por más que tú la llames tampoco va a contestar
Ahora ella anda solo de rumba y tú te derrumbas
Lloras tú porque sus lágrimas no valoraste
Hasta tu madre dice que no la cuidaste
Su corazón te odia por lo mal que la trataste
Y si te ve en la calle seguro te saca el de'o
La cogiste de pendeja, ahora tú eres su pendejo (Wuh)
Tú caíste muy bajo, en la fiesta borracho
Te merece' en tu vida todo' los cacho' (Toma)
Y ya sabemo' que tú anda' malherido (Laramercy gang)
En la vida to' se paga porque fuiste un malparido (Fa-rru)

Todo cambió, dio un giro 360°
Se puso má' rica y está puesta pa' la vuelta
No quiere saber de ti, quemando pa' la venta
El carajo, brother, calma, te pasó la cuenta (Pum-pum-pum)
Y ahora anda rollin' rompiendo la calle (Eah)
Se cansó, ya no quiere coro con nadie
Le cogió el gusto y ya no hay quién la pare
Y ahora está difícil de nuevo que la jale (Farru)
Ahora ella quiere carretera
Y ahora más que ahora está soltera
Bebe y fuma la noche entera
Y le da tremenda loquera
Cuando coge la borrachera
Le da con oír ""Safaera""
Y le entra la bellaquera
Pero no se la da a cualquiera
Pri-yah-yah-yah-yah, ¡Farru!

Ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella (Prr)
Mari y una botella (¿Qué, qué?)
Gracia' al maltrato se puso bella (What?)
Ahora tú la quiere' y no te quiere ella (Wuh, wuh)
Ahora todo cambió, le toca a ella (¿Qué?)
Hookah y una botella (D-D-D-D.Y)

Ahora tú la quiere' y no te quiere ella

Don't even ask how I'm livin' (Facts)
Niggas ain't real, they cap (Cap)
Ridin' round with the seat laid back
They told me to chill, I'm itchin' to clap
If I pull up, somebody get whacked
Boy, tie your laces, niggas tripping
Red lights, we gon' skip it
Fucked up a new V, we was dippin'
From the police, I was drillin'
But fuck it, let's skate on, huh
Run up a bag with my bro gods, huh (Bro)
Watch how I show off
Step in the room and she takin' her clothes off
I ain't even say much, huh
Ain't even do much
They like, ""Sleepy, you too much""

Know I live a fast life
Said she fell in love, met her last night, huh
Said she want this shit for life

No, I'm not the type
I think I was lost in a past life
Came back, got my cash right
Say you want the sauce, I can get you right
But it's heavyweight, not light (Hold up, hold up)

He be shootin', he don't like to fight
I could get you wrapped up like a gift
Smoked up like a spliff
Chopper tell 'em back up or get hit
Got my racks up, now I'm lit
I could get you packed up in this bitch
And my blood blue 'cause I'm Crip
Fanny pack full of hundreds (That's a fact)
I just reach on my waist, seen he runnin' (Fuck outta here)
Bitches say a nigga stuntin', huh (Nigga stuntin')
Know they hate how I came up from nothin'
Backed down, get to drummin' (Baow, baow)
I'ma show a nigga how I'm comin'
I was down, now I'm uppin' (Now I'm up)
They was hatin' on me, now they lovin' (Oh wait, hold on)

I ain't never do you wrong, so tell me why you don't trust me
She don't do this often, she said it's only because me
You the one who want it, therefore you can never judge me
She just wanna party and nothing's wrong with that
Every time I'm calling, she say she gon' call me back
I told her call me Rocky, she say she not gon' call me that
You say you come with a lot, well, baby, I want all of that
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too

Tell 'em again, tell 'em off (Tell 'em off)
It just dawned on me (On me), what's right, feels wrong
No, no wingman, that's only my A-game
At this game, two can play
Kill your vibe, they don't have the right
Baby don't fight it, you're giving me life
Take your time, set the mood right
Settle down, skeptical at first but now I'm not

Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)

Yeah, yeah, saving my time for you
Suddenly I freed up (Free)
Freezing my times with you
When I'm lonely, I can bring them up
Closed off my line for you (Closing down my line)
I'm better when I'm just on my own, girl
Standing in line for you (Standing in line for you)
Standing here for I don't know how long, girl
Things I wrote (Ayy), lengths I go
Lets you know that I want you
Words we spoke (Yeah), things you wrote
Let me know that you want me too (Yeah)
Ikebe, pressing on me heavy
Pressing up against me real close
Bakasi, moving on me wassy
Time is moving real slow
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Swae-lee-wont-be-late-lyrics,2019-08-31

Well, if I may speak freely, we gon' get a bag if we need it
Bust it down, flip it, repeat it
Suckas be greedy, we was never playin' in the game
If we was, before we lost, we cheated
Hold up, they ain't made a game you can play on me
I just be prayin' for these niggas that they prey on me
They got another thing comin', homie, they gon' see
I got the blessings of an angel every day on me
Okay, church, nigga used to ask me where I'm from
Tell 'em Bankhead, nigga, but the earth my turf
Work, wonder what's up under my shirt
Wonder why I ain't gettin' searched
Nigga, TIP been solid, speak against his name in the hood
And you will get slapped out 'bout it
Had straps out wildin', but moments in the past
Just made me who I am, that's why I don't run from it
Keep it one hunnid', anyone who don't like it, then fuck 'em
Get a little money then double, level
Came a way from sellin' weed in the envelope
To Puff Daddy standin' with me in chinchilla
Road run, Rubber Band Man
Made a hundred mil' off of fifty grand man, well, goddamn
My suggestion is that you follow your dreams in this bitch
Put your heart in this shit, you bound to get rich, no cap

I just wore two million worth of jewelry to an interview
I got people askin' me, ""What the fuck done got into you?""
I done put it all on the line, I knew that the rent was due
Hard to go and get it, no trippin', it wasn't no handouts
Corner store got hot, we start sellin' 'em out my man house
We ain't never have nothin', stay pullin' bands out
I been runnin' it up and I heard he ran out
Know these pussy niggas wishin' shit would fan out, it won't
""How you make the gun go on safety?"" It don't
""You that young turnt nigga, Baby?"" For shit, sure
Never in my feelings 'bout a broad, she can hit, bro
Red inside, Rolls truck, call it Big Boat
Heard a nigga say he want smoke
Switch out my clip on my pole, had to add a lil' more
I ain't really up for no arguin'

Shut up, sucka nigga, get up
Crazy in your head thinkin' you can get us hit up
Foreign, automotives all on my lawn
Yawn, did this so long, it's gettin' borin'
Tapped into the culture, made a motherfuckin' lifestyle
Shoutout to my niggas doin' trap music right now
And you know we ain't with the hype, million on the mic
Get to switchin' out a queen just 'cause she ain't what we like, ay
I'm a king, done my thing from the green to the white
When you finished with opinions, I got four or five classics
Say I ain't the shit, that nigga must be dippin' acid
Fuck what all them other niggas doin', all I know is keep goin'
Start gettin' money, enjoyed it
Started sellin' crack for employment
Make it out of Georgia, that was a nigga only intent
Get them suckas out the way and get rich
Blockin' my path, boy, the .40 cal start barkin'
Like my nigga DMX in this bitch
I'm a vet at this shit, and all I ever been was authentic
Twenty years, I been handlin' my business
Get in my bag, stackin' my pennies
Buyin' everything on the west side of the city
'Cause that's where all the niggas don't play about TIP
So what I care 'bout what you got to say about TIP?

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it

Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts

I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend

And I planned it out for weeks now

You see my face again

Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my

You won't remember all my

Stress and holiday shopping traffic

Just like magic

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name

Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

Just let it go, let it go

Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?

And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show
But you showed who you are, then one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't

Tell your friends you're out for a run

Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop

Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies

El cuchillo corta por ambos extremos
Si el zapato te queta, camina con él hasta que se rompan los tacones

Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet

The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other

Pack your dolls and a sweater

It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

Would everything be different today?

But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face

The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone

Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad

Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least I'm trying

It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you

Me hizo ver mal
Repaso todos mis pasos en cada escalón
Intentando encontrar en cuál me equivoqué
Escribo cartas
Destinadas al fuego

Capturando mi muerte
Y no podía estar segura
Tuve un sentimiento tan particular
De que este dolor sería

Oye, diciembre
Creo que me siento sin ataduras
No puedo recordar
Por lo que solía pelear
Rebobino la cinta pero lo único que hace es pausarse
En el mismo momento, todo estaba perdido
Mandando señales
Para que me traicionaran
Y recuperaba mi aliento

Capturando mi muerte

¿Hay alguna línea que podría sólo cruzar?

Y cuando estaba en el naufragio (No puedo pensar en todo el costo)
Pensé en ti (Todas las cosas que se perderán ahora)
En las grietas de la luz (¿Podemos tomarnos una pausa?)
Soñé contigo (Para estar seguros, llegaremos a lo alto de nuevo, si piensas en todos los costos)

In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

Ooh-ah
You'll get better

Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, ""That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account""
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

She says, ""I think he did it, but I just can't prove it""

Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me

Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it

1168,10362,Taylor Swift Featuring The National,Taylor Swift,Coney Island,1,63,"Seni ararken ruhum ikiye ayrılıyor
Ama tam buradasın
Artık seninle ilişki kuramazsam
O zaman ben kiminle ilişkiliyim?
Ve eğer bu uzun mesafe ise
Buraya bu kadar çabuk nasıl geldik?
Yumruğumu hassas bir şeyin etrafına mı sardım?
Ben sana zarar mı verdim?

Ve Coney Island'da bir bankta oturuyorum
Bebeğimin nereye gittiğini merak ediyorum
Hızlı zamanlar, parlak ışıklar, mutlu işler
Seni orta sayfam yapmadığım için üzgünüm

Tekrar ve tekrar
Şaşırtıcı olmayan bir şekilde yine kaybettim
Hayal kırıklıkları, gözlerini kapat
Ve gittikçe soğuyor ve soğuyor
Güneş battığında

Bir soru kafamı meşgul еdiyor
Bir ömür boyu başarı nedir
Seni kenara ittiysеm
Ama beni terk etmek için çok kibardın
Ve ruju özlüyor musun
Seni cennete kim ikna etti ve orada bıraktı?
Ruhumu affedecek misin
Bana güvenemeyecek kadar akıllı ve umursamayacak kadar yaşlı olduğunda?
Çünkü internetten önceki alışveriş merkezi gibiydik
Olunması gereken tek yer orasıydı
Yaramazlık, hediye paketli banliyö rüyaları
Sana bir arcade yüzüğü kazanamadığım için üzgünüm

Tekrar ve tekrar
Şaşırtıcı olmayan bir şekilde yine kaybettim
Hayal kırıklıkları, gözlerini kapat
Ve gittikçe soğuyor ve soğuyor
Güneş battığında

Eski yerimizde mi bekliyordun
Ağaç çizgisinde
Altın saate göre
Seni her gün asılı bıraktım mı?
Koridorda mı duruyordun
Büyük bir pasta ile, mutlu yıllar
Senin en mavi gökyüzünü en koyu griye boyadım mı?
Evren kadar uzak
Ve kazaya girdiğimde
Önümde parıldayan görüntü senin yüzündü
Ama podyuma çıktığımda sanırım adını söylemeyi unuttum
Ve Coney Island'da bir bankta oturuyorum
Bebeğimin nereye gittiğini merak ediyorum
Hızlı zamanlar, parlak ışıklar, mutlu işler
Seni orta sayfam yapmadığım için üzgünüm

Tekrar ve tekrar
Şaşırtıcı olmayan bir şekilde tekrar kaybettim
Hayal kırıklıkları, gözlerini kapat
Ve gittikçe soğuyor ve soğuyor
Güneş battığında

Güneş battığında
Önümde parıldayan görüntü senin yüzündü

(Internet Money, bitch, hahahaha)
Yeah, yeah

I remember times when I ain't have shit
No food in my crib, now I live lavish (Oh, no-no-no)
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you, I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

My life been tragic, thank you for askin'
I've seen too many of my fam end up in caskets
I've seen too many of my friends turned into ashes
Wish I still had them
Light a blunt, put it to the sky, I'm tryna get high (High)
They won't stop, look me in my eyes, tell me it's alright (Alright)
Had to cut plenty people off, money on my mind
I can't fuck with 'em, I can't trust nobody but I (Yeah)
I remember times when I ain't have shit (Yeah)
No food in my crib, now I live lavish
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you, I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

They hate so bad-bad, huh, my money up, they fake as fuck
I know they mad-mad, huh, I still ain't done, I ain't switchin' up
I ain't givin' up, I'm goin' in, word to my friends
I ain't thinking clear, tell me what I did, I just whipped the Benz
I'd give it all back right now just to see you smile
I'd give my hoes back, on slime, just to hear you now
They ain't my friend, ain't my woadie, ain't my dawg
For to get some money be the only reason that they come around
And the top down, everythin' goin' smoothly
Hope they don't try me, come out on top, I'm shootin' 'round
When I'm up in town
Haters after me but got so many of 'em for me (Yeah), I can't let 'em down

I remember times when I ain't have shit (Yeah)
No food in my crib, now I live lavish (Top)
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know

She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here this evening, I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building, so hot
Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?

You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch

Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

It rang a couple times, and she picked up
I can always hear her smile when I call
I just called to tell you that I loved you
I was missing you and dad and home, that's all

About what's important

You are the alleged shooter of Megan Thee Stallion

Was she backtracking with what she said originally?
You know, maybe that's why we don't have a report

Some bitches tryna  take up for Tory and, ""It's more to the story,"" bitch, it ain't-there ain't nothing to the story

Well, hold up—
Donkey of the Day
What I’m looking like, he looking at the police and then shot her?
Niggas like that, you a sucker, he's the king sucker, he’s the-he's the biggest sucker in the industry (Facts)
We gotta talk about Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion
Kaash is looking for you, dawg
Because the police came out saying, ""We didn't even know she was shot""
Guess who I believe? Megan
The best thing for Tory Lanez is for real, he needs to just begone
I'm done with this, you gotta know the truth
Ayy, they rather see me in the cell
Like how he posted out with thirty thousand dollar bail?
I’m the GOAT, y'all niggas know I made that dope float on the scale
I had them hoes goin' crazy, fiends crackin', goin' pale
They know I'm real, I got that flow, it's on sale if you need a rush

Ho caught me D'd up, talk down, we T'ing up
Megan people tryna frame me for a shootin'
But them boys ain't clean enough
I see how they teamin' up, watchin' and I'm calculatin'
Gotta keep it quiet, I can't jeopardize the outcome waitin'
Seein' certain niggas hatin', like, how this nigga hatin'?
I done gave these people so much features, made these niggas famous
They was on the blog sayin' I'm canceled from this entertainment
I was on that Spotify like thirty million monthly listeners, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
And my fans support me brazy, everythin' I do is for you, I promise I'll be on it daily
I got nothin' but love to spread, but niggas hate me
Hurt my heart to see them Twitter fingers come from Kehlani's and Kaash Paige's
But I flipped the switch, I'm grippin' money at that fast pace
And don't ask me for shit when it get real, that's my last favor
Can't cry now 'cause I'ma laugh later
Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on that affidavit
Knowin' I ain't do it but I'm comin' at my truest
Tryna keep this shit two hunnid with you, shorty, I can prove it
But them people in yo ear, they the true ones that I fear
They really got you thinkin' Tory Lanez would do you in, for real
Don't forget you was my bitch, I held it down and kept it real
I would never paint no fake picture of you just for some mills
And I thought that you was solid too, but look at how you doin' me
Look at how you doin' me, people tryna ruin me
And what's even worse is I'm still thinkin' about you and me
How you goin' live my birthday with all your jewelry to try to make some fool of me?
But I love you hard so I'm gon' cool it, B

Somehow I'm still down to renegotiate the unity

But when they took that from me, they really took that from my baby
What the fuck I'm finna say to his old lady?
What the fuck y'all mean, my son don't need a house?
My baby momma don't need safety?
And even though I got the payment, the real estate niggas still hatin'

How the fuck your team is tryna to paint me as some whole menace?
I just lost like ten million dollars because this cold business
But I got like ten million followers that's gon' roll with me
Fans that support me 'cause they know my heart
So I don't give a damn if shorty know Jigga
I was taught to beat the block
Eeny, meeny, miney in these streets, and so my Nina cocked
Niggas, y'all can play me, y'all can frame me, but I'ma reach the top
I would never put you in no danger, and if I did, you would've said it when you seen the cops
Ayy, Lamborghini bands and they comin' out the floor
Fff, hit the fan when I'm pullin' out the dough-oh
I would never fall out with niggas over hoes, ayy
Money over fall outs, my nigga, that's the code-oh
Santorini bands when I pull up to the coast
Better have my bands when I pull up to the door-oh
Niggas can't believe I done pulled up in a Ghost
And I don't ever wanna fuck with y'all no more, G

I got bad bitches tryna have a orgy
Keep umbrellas for the days it get stormy
I pour the Henny for my niggas, that's before me
My outfit fly, you gotta seat out by the floor seats
She tatted me all on her face 'cause she adore me
They talkin' petty 'bout me but they lookin' corny
I had to fight for mine, nigga, you were sworn in
And God bless me when I wake up every mornin'12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Tory-lanez-money-over-fallouts-lyrics,2020-10-10

And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit

All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose

Да-да, да
Мхм-мхм, Мхм-мхм
Мхм-мхм, Мхм-мхм

Знаешь, что это за футболка?
Позовите дядю Вильямса — нас накроет Хайп
Тебя позабудут сразу же, ты — не угроза
Весь этот кэш не с кроссовок

Cacti — не просто холодный чай
Он так дурманит, Я — гений Спайк Ли
Обшарь весь Google — меня не отыщешь
Я назвал её деткой, чтоб она тащилась
Немыслимо, чума-чума, оригинально
Создал лейбл, чтоб не париться
Меня не разлучишь с Chase B
Мы — не разлей вода, наводим криминал, будь вежлив
""Я его видел, правда""; а ты видел эту футболку?
Хей, мои парни уже здесь
Мы полетим во Францию, наблюдать за зрелищем
А ты и дальше злись, написывая в соц. сетях
Пока я катаюсь на своей бабочке Ferrari
Защищая свою честь, я заставил судью дать мне слово
Сделал 20 мультов, не продавая душу дьяволу — удача
Оставь прелюдии, Бруклин скучает по Башару
Будь со мной вежлив
Держать её связанной — не моё
Трэвис, где шнурки? Раз их нет, то и меня не свяжешь
Я выше облаков, но это не Skype
Да, посмотри на мой ""Slime""
Это мой расцвет сил
Светлячок, не злись ты так
Выприте этого плаксу

Знаешь, что это за футболка? (Да)
Позовите дядю Вильямса — нас накроет Хайп (Вот это жара)
Тебя позабудут сразу же, ты — не угроза
Весь этот кэш не с кроссовок

Извини-ни-ни-ни-ни-ни-ни, но перестань ныть
Миссисипи — окунись разумом, раз тебе нужны подражатели
Пусть попробуют разозлить меня
Я готов дохрена потратить
Скажи, когда тебя забрать, скоро мы разнесём чертей в прах
Здесь есть абсолютно всё: рыба, фрукты, ягоды
Быстрый карт, как Kawasaki — наслаждение полноценной жизнью
Переехала в сердце Лондона
Таг и Трэвис — моя семья
Ага, и ты это знаешь
Наше время скоро настанет, ты слышишь, Кодак?
Подбрось меня, Я — мяч, летящий над кольцом
Я рвал и метал, никого не боясь — стремлюсь к идеалу
Бессонница атакует, пытаюсь её устранить, предпринимаю меры
Ворота в утопию скоро будут распахнуты для нас всех
Видишь кресты над собой? Это мы настигли твою душу
Позвоню тебе в рассвет не для разговоров
Парни из JACKBOYS очистят весь район, посмотри на нас

Знаешь, что это за футболка?
Позовите дядю Вильямса — нас накроет Хайп
Тебя позабудут сразу же, ты — не угроза
Весь этот кэш не с—, кэш не с—

Я всегда там, где есть пламя
Мы разорвём эту систему
Мы разорвём эту систему
Мы — Месопотамские Боги
Мы разорвём эту систему
Мы разорвём эту систему

Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'

Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya

She's not developed like we are

We can finally be together

You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

""Merry Christmas"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you"", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears (Ohh)
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Special...
Someone, someone, I'll give it to someone, someone special

Who give me something in return
I'll give it to someone—
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay (Oh, oh)
How could you love me for a day
I thought you were someone special
Gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
You gave it away
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—

Nails done, lemon braids, they're so pretty, girl, ah
She don't be in any world
Wrong shoe, wrong fit, no Cinderella, girl
Car basic
Bro big mad it's not him that she chasin'
Two weeks, he couldn't find a replacement
He done lost a good bitch, downgraded to a basic
Lane switch
Bitch is lucky, call her sour folk 'cause she change
'Cause she don't care
Sold her nigga on OfferedUp, notched up
Turned off her pipe and then she bossed up
On any bitch head who got an issue
Mace a bitch up, tear your drawers, she might spit too
Messy, take your nigga if she want to
Give him pussy, got him stuck, he said I love you on the first day
You bitches couldn't see her on her worst day
Fly bitch like first day of school on her birthday
Ooh, she nasty, F-R-E-A-K
Ride dick, bicyc'
Make a nigga bust in a M-I-N

Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him, ""It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye""
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

Bite like tarantula, bitch, I'm an animal
Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy
Haha, murder on my mind, whoa, whoa
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)

Brown and white, like I go cunch
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (Buss)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust
White rum, fizzy pop (Pop)
Where you dey go? (go) We dey go up
Catch my vibe (Vibe), let me go off (Off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

Aight yo, put the Belaire on her batty, make it kotch
Seen the watch, now she wanna give crotch
Boy got ps, now she hopping in the pod
Man in real life sugar, gyaldem haffi get wopped (Yeah)
Know she want dark, told her ""Meet me at the top""
Switching lanes the other day, I seen her waiting for a bus
Baby this a Moncler sweater, Diesel denim
Buy another while my pockets fat like Heather
Neck froze like I don't know no better
Benzo truck, white seats and they leather
Go broke never, on my grind
She make it clap like I'm Busta Rhymes
I got the juice, the sauce and all them things
I blammed her twice tonight with all my bling
Big Benz, I drive, I brought that ting
Any girl you want, they want my ting
Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch

Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust
White rum, fizzy pop (Pop)
Where you dey go? (go) We dey go up
Catch my vibe (Vibe), let me go off (Off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

Flood my ice, make a ho blush
Back at the tour bus, gettin' caught up
DSquared got 'em distressed, gotta hand wash
New racks with the old Nikes in the shoe box
Keep my stripes, no cuffs
Pull up in a new plate and she might just
She weren't tryna move bait when our eyes locked
New tints on the coupé, that's her head lost
Off my whites, right my wrongs
Gucci my mum, while you diddle your thumbs
Count my sums, this is gonna get long
Love my green, I'm tryna get strong
Tryna get bun, where I'm from, it's on
Yes, man don't take no dumb, threats
They see funds, they hop, fence
We been up, not up next
Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (Buss)

White rum, fizzy pop (Pop)
Where you dey go? (go) We dey go up
Catch my vibe (Vibe), let me go off (Off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

And introducing
The one and only

Big truck, no clutch (Clutch)
Wrist froze, don't touch
French Ciri, I'm so drunk (Turnt)
Course I can't drink and drive, where's my chauffeur?
Bando upsuh, whip that coca
I really hope this time my worker don't floss
See, I was in the wok, now my penthouse at the top
Shawty said they're best friends, I bet they both fuck
'Cause they won't cuss, 'cause they said I sold drugs
And when you down there, ain't nobody around
Where's the comeback? When you blow up
I forgot my jacket but my heated seats help me warm up
Fast train to Inverurie, I used to go up
It's ironic, I just sold out my show in Scotland
Used to say I wanna put Tottenham on the map
But one day I'ma change the map in Tottenham
Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (Buss)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust

You know where the bag at, tell me where it is
I came from rags to riches, I'm the shit
I can no longer disguise it, bitch, 'cause I'm rich

I escaped every one of the licks 'cause I was supposed to be rich
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is

Ask me how they do it, kickin' shit, Ryu, Ken
Put it in a cab, send it to a Arab

Fuck around and air the pussy nigga out like linen
Last nigga tried me almost got popped in Lenox

Ask the cops and the detectives, all the jurisdictions
Ask the kids at school who ambition all the missions
Gave the lawyer close to two mil', he handle all the killings

Soprano, no Soprino, we live life like Yung Bino
Had a show in B-more, after that post on the block with Chino (I'm a hustlin' motherfucker)
Look for a star on every hundred, C note
I'm the top on YouTube, fuck a new school, I don't use no Vevo
These niggas 'round me, they too cruel, they bust tools and die for me, though
I don't pay money for no life, the murder pay off me, so
Came out alright
But I'm blinded from the life, I can’t see, though
Got juveniles on the block, thirty stick hangin' out the Glock
Bandana tied 'round the clip, and they go all out for me, though

Sucked all the pain up, let's fuck the game up
Plenty niggas on the block pushin' that rock (It's the Carter's son)
You got your change up, they brought your name up
When it's war, we wet they block, and when it's said, this shit'll never be done
I can't say I'm fucking with all this involvement
These niggas ain't right and they ballin'
I don't give a fuck, no, I call up Osama, my baba
Like, ""Load up and come and rob all them"" (Rob all them)
Venezuela ventilator
My first trip to Georgia made 'em
Some companions with ambitions, was
Double G, NBA native
I wish baptism could've saved us
Never broke until the grave in
Excuse ourselves, knock on the tables
I make a pussy bite the pavement
I can't say I'm fucking with all this involvement
These niggas ain't right and they ballin'
I don't give a fuck, no, I call up Osama, my baba
Like, ""Load up and come and rob all them"" (Rob all them)
Came out alright
But I'm blinded from the life, I can’t see, though
Got juveniles on the block, thirty stick hangin' out the Glock
Bandana tied 'round the clip, and they go all out for me, though

It's gutter, I struggled
I let her go shopping for me 'cause I know that it's all on the muscle
Teach you how to hustle
This Givenchy 'fit I got on that you bought me, these hoes love it

Dump dead, Q feel everything gone

Late-night blues at the cemetery
Go and catch a body, I'll see you in Heaven
Northside 38, 4Trey steppin'
Green leave you red, that's flag activity
Stay sticked up, that's real infinity
Big bro chemist in the kitchen
Young bad bitch, I ain't got no chemistry

You’ll never make me lose
So why you bragging on me?
Your ways was cruel, I was fooled
I was too blind for to see
My I.D. cover the news
Seems only trouble I keep
You was the one I would choose
Choose for to be there for me
Can't tell me not to do this because I do what I want
We came up out the street
Straight from the block selling raw
She said, she never would leave
Soon as she left it was hard
I wanted her here with me
She left me out with my boys
But I say, ""That’s okay""
Protect my heart with that rod
I’m running far out your reach
I mean as far as the stars
Might have to cancel my cards
Don't come out after dark
I see she won't leave me ‘lone
She slashed the tires on my car
Dirty Iyanna, oh

Forever we get it, I'm sick of these bitches, they flow in my head, ah
We be chasing the riches, however you want it
Aim straight for the head, ah
And she know that I love her, she want me to cuff her
I think she’ll hurt me, I never would let her
I'm sending condolences inside of a letter
Still trappin' like Griselda
No, it ain't safe in these streets, all alone, ah
No, we don't play, keep that heat, we take his soul, ah
Even though when I’m wrong, I ain't never gon' lie
If I feel that I owe you, I'm gon' make it right
I'll be thuggin' and keepin' my head to the sky
Double back on a lap by myself and I cry
In the bed while I'm dreaming behind you I die
Before that can happen, I let off that fire
Trappin' and rappin', we shoot to the top
After I'm asking ""Can we have a child?""
After heartbreak, I’ll cut off relations
But I be thinkin' 'bout you on the daily
Tell my niggas what up and they say that I'm crazy
Remember wit' you all them hoes, they hatin'

Hello? This is Mike Laury
Dubba-AA flexin'

SK's, machine guns, it's two of us with four nines
Trippin' off no broke nigga, that fuck nigga get blowed down
Ridin' 'round with them sticks, nigga, these bitch niggas get rolled down
You wasn't never with the shit, nigga, we'll slide on em, they know it now
This is the sound
Pull up with them poles, nigga froze and get shot down
YoungBoy in control, niggas know I blow your block down
He was with his bros talkin' bold, but he not now (Fuck that)
You want some fame, we got them glizzies, get you hot now

Money on your head, I get you bankrolled
I'll whack your mammy and your daddy if you ain't know
She actin' classy, throw some money on a stank ho
I pull up actin' with that ratchet in my raincoat
Whip out that Glock, get out your top and get your brain blowed
We got them Hellcats but we dippin' in Durangos
Go with your move, we pop your ass and get your name known
And that's a fact, that nigga mad because his mans gone
I just rolled me up an opp, I get my ""Bang"" on
You bitches don't want war with us, Jay, this the same song
These niggas lyin', they scared to ride where my gang roams
Hop out the back and spray this bitch without no aim on, hold on
AK, machine guns, 50 Glocks, they big as hell
Fuck niggas get banged on, scary ass, they run and tell
Hoppin' out with my chains on, bitch nigga, don't tuck no tail
YoungBoy, Lil Top, nigga, bitch nigga, don't say Kentrell

SK's, machine guns, it's two of us with four nines
Trippin' off no broke nigga, that fuck nigga get blowed down

Pull up with them poles, nigga froze and get shot down
YoungBoy in control, niggas know I blow your block down
He was with his bros talkin' bold, but he not now (Fuck that)
You want some fame, we got them glizzies, get you hot now

When I was in jail, I was with Nadi on the line, nigga
He say he want him gone, we check him off 'cause he wasn't slime, nigga
Laid inside my bunk, I slept with murder on my mind, nigga
I'ma knock them niggas off like back-to-back, bitch, when it's time, nigga
Bitch, it's homicide when it's time to ride, all you niggas dyin'
Them bullets flyin', niggas go to droppin' with no fuckin' sign

Should've known that it get ugly when it's up but ain't no fuckin' hidin'

I just wanna be loved
D-Mac on the fuckin' track
Don’t nobody understand me though
Tahj Money
The way I came in the game
The image that I had put out
They wouldn't expect me to have feelings
Know it probably don't seem like it
That’s why they talk about me like I ain't human, but we all is
But I'm still being me
I'm still in the streets and I'm still thuggin' until them niggas put me under, yeah
That's how we livin' and that's how we going out, you hear me? Open your mouth

I say, mama, I'm so sorry
I got ice burned where my heart at
On the road where I had it hard at
How I'm chosen? I'm so heartless, so, so heartless
I ain't know my age, he was 16, they killed Lil Dave
Mind in a rage, I'm way too young to feel this pain
I ain't know how to fade, but I dove in 'cause I'm a man
I love that girl to death, as we get old, our feelings change
I pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me
They keep on draggin' me, I play for keeps, they scared of me
I cannot barely, can barely sleep or even breathe
I cannot hold on without you on side of me
I never knew this fame would take the ones I love from ‘way from me
I wanna see Kacey bad, but I can't seem to call Nene
Go in with no pen and pad, I got this shit right on my sleeve
Right now my candle burning wax, I'm feelin' like it's burnin' me
I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild

I fell in love with Kaylyn, without even knowin' this bitch done snaked me
I'm missin' Yaya daily, the one who don't make me feel basic
Happiness I'm chasin', while killers behind me tryna blank me
You don't know what I'm feelin'
Or what I'm thinkin' and you can't change me
I miss my fuckin' daddy, I've been callin' Montana my father
Times been gettin' harder
I came from nothing, now bitch, I'm royal
I call Monique my mama, but Lord knows I need Sheronda
I don't need no commas, I'm feeling like I'm going under
My paw-paw getting old, and once he gone, I'm on my own
Right now I'm all alone, I pray that grandmom keep me strong
Can't even leave my home, my bracelet beeping plus I'm down
I just wan' be gone, my son straight, my money long
Tell me what you feelin', I hope that I can help you out
My youngins in that North, I pray that y'all gon' make it out
These bitches comin' 'round, and they don't even like my songs
I'll burn up the town, before them niggas bust my dome
I wish that I can hear Dump say, ""What up, lil brother,"" one more time
We killing shit and plus we dying
I'm gon' go off behind my brother, fuck this charge, I slang that iron
Before he go and I don't ride
I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild
I'm just a lonely child
Who need someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, my pain away
Because my thoughts been runnin' wild

Oh, oh Lord
I need some help because my life been real hard
The way I approached the game, it seem that I'm hard
But I got feelings too just like a lil' boy, oh Lord
I'm a grandmom baby11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Youngboy-never-broke-again-lonely-child-lyrics,2019-10-26

We be robbin' and schemin' (On God), oh Lord
How long would it be until this pain gon' go?
Straight from the bottom, blow a bag on my bros, oh, yeah, yeah
Just for his head, a hundred thousand, say less, I pay that
Got plenty money, but I had to jump up out my bag
Ride foreign ride, got plenty money, but that north where I reside at
But I'd fly miles 'cross this town to see you smile
She be fans of other niggas, like this bitch wan' be a hype man
But the minute I wan' be alone, she don't like that
I took heed into your letters, I was locked up with no celly
I ain't wanna be nowhere but with you
From the bottom all the way back to my section
Everyday, yeah, we be steppin'
Fuck chasin', I will not be through
I'm all caught up with money, like, ""Fuck this dream, it ain't nothin'""
And fuck these hoes that don't love me, niggas don't like how I be stuntin'
I miss Big Dump like my granny, we still at war 'bout my cousin
Diggin' 'but I ain't searchin' for gold, I know I'm lookin' for somethin'

I'ma ride that red eye (Red eye), like a demon
Stack that money 'til I can't no more (No more)

I gotta bring it
Any time and however you want it
Late at night and I can't sleep
I'm staying up, I'm tossing, turning
That's them bodies from my temper creeping on me
That's from me cuttin' 'em off and being home all by my lonely
Bricks and bales
I prefer that chopper, it's gon' kiss you and won't never tell
I can cook that dope just like a worker, you can ask VL
Look and I can eyeball, I don't talk loud, I don't need a scale
Plenty money, but I'm still thuggin', this the rich as hell

Get it and bring it, I flip it
You know how I get it, I know some hard layers
I can speak that work and talk that work
I leave it scarred and pale
Presser, I got solids on that semi, bust your head for real (Presser)
Give me head and then I flip or get that dick for real
Ballin', my niggas haulin'
Niggas be talkin' and I catch 'em walkin'
I do this often, fuck it, I off 'em
Know that I got 'em, you know I'ma stalk 'em
Fuck his fam, I pick his coffin
Catch who bad? Bitch, I doubt it
I got youngins wanna off 'em
All this smoke, it got me coughin'
MAC's-11, I be steppin', bitch, I'm reckless, I'm dumb
Catch you wrestling in your section with that Wesson, you slumped
I got bro on top, ain't tell through a message, we come
We hang guns with them drums, Draco sounding like a bomb
Yeah, you talk that shit, I'm with it, hmm
Watch how quick I whip it
I go Shmurda with them glizzies
I got murder on my tension
I got black on top my lenses
I got straps inside that Bentley
You wan' play, I make you feel it
Come your way, make sure you get it
Bitch, I trap out like Griselda, hollows, I mail 'em
Mojo with my celly, police walk in, I won't tell 'em
Talkin' on my celly with this bitch who came from Heaven
Stutter in my precious, I got uh-uh in my mansion

I gotta bring it
Any time and however you want it
Late at night and I can't sleep
I'm staying up, I'm tossing, turning
That's them bodies from my temper creeping on me
That's from me cuttin' 'em off and being home all by my lonely
Bricks and bales
I prefer that chopper, it's gon' kiss you and won't never tell
I can cook that dope just like a worker, you can ask VL
Look and I can eyeball, I don't talk loud, I don't need a scale
Plenty money, but I'm still thuggin', this the rich as hell

Whip that bitch out and she lick it
Check how a nigga be kickin'
I got cases pending, I got THC, it's liquid
If I point, them youngins hit it
I got bitches throwin' up Billy, Blood
I got problems, really, I piss out red inside the tub
Choppin' it
Run her a song, she follow that
Smoking strong, a pressure pack inside my bag, got big racks
She took the Roxies out her pocket, told that bitch don't sniff that
'Cause bitch, I'ma kick you out, you know that we ain't with that
I put that strap in her mouth, bitch
I thought I told you don't talk, bitch
I don't care 'bout what they talkin', fuck her best friend, bitch, I'm rich
Fuck your man man, ho, I'm lit
Plus my whole clique full of pits
I go put on Fendi pants
Thot, your dad can't drip like this
Bitch, I trap out like Griselda, hollows, I mail 'em
Mojo with my celly, police walk in, I won't tell 'em
Talkin' on my celly with this bitch who came from Heaven
Stutter in my precious, I got uh-uh in my mansion

I gotta bring it
Any time and however you want it

Stretch me one, I can't sleep, bang out when I see you

You won't have no case, rearrange your shape soon as they face you
You won't have no space, we in your section 'til we spray you

Put your mask on, yeah, they comin' out
Soon as they close that door, we just gon' walk down
They say we dead wrong 'cause we knocked him off
But he who got caught lackin', tell that bitch that that's his fault
If we draw down, guns get let off
At all them clowns, including his spouse
Kept that blick inside my drawers
Every time I walked to Dalton
I worked for Tim and sold CD's
You throw a diss and you get tossed
Say you ain't catch that, cross my name up, ain't no talking (Yeah)
If they had a bang-out at the store, from my papa window, I could see it sparkin'
But I ain't seen that since Jordan Dixon made some niggas some targets
Big 40, got that shit on me in a stolo, nigga knowin' that it's retarded
I spit that shit that cause a massacre at the party, believe that

I'ma aim with the strap at his fitted
Throwin' out the murder bags in my city
Play-by-play while I'm standin' on Billy
Dirty Drac', take the top off the Hemi
Fully equipped it when we go on a mission
Take his face, I ain't showin' no pity
Closed case, tell them all good riddance
Zombieland where the dogs can scent it
Sprinter van and we all be in it
Catch him first, get a raw percentage
If you want, I put a coffin in it
I could get you one from inside my home
I just want to check the bitch out for attendance
Tell them niggas I say fuck 'em all
And I'ma kill all you bitches (That's on your mama, bitch)
I said right foot creep, ooh, I'm walking with that heater
Look around, stay low, make sure they don't see you

And we ain't come here for to lose, we want it all
Smokin' dro 'cause I need it
So I could be calm instead of dangerous when you see me
You niggas know we quick to let it blow for any reason
Kick down your door, post up on your front porch, and we ain't leavin'

When my grandma died, I had to beat the odds and it wasn't easy
When Boozilla died, I almost lost my mind, broke me to pieces
We was slangin' iron for Dump and all the rest, it ain't no secret
38 across my neck, we be them boys you don't want beef with
Smokin' dro, smell it when I hit the door, 'cause I need it
I ain't the one, these pussy niggas know I be fiendin'
Hop out the car with diamonds 'round my throat, bitch, I'm beamin'
I don't think no nigga can't see me, I be paranoid while I'm leanin'

Testin' your gun inside of the backyard, let it hit, get your aim up
My youngin official, he wait in your backyard, and I call him the bang thug
Wake up in the morning, get fresh as a bitch, I'ma walk in Dior and some Margielas
And the way we gon' dump at the boy with the stick, I'ma finish him off with a four nickel
I be thinkin' 'bout Dump all over the time, this shit just don't feel right
I don't go to no club, I be takin' these drugs, ridin' and keepin' that steel tight

Tell 'em lil' niggas I said for them not to walk in
Up with the Glock, let off ten
Poppin' them bottles of lean with Instagram models, stayin' at the Drury Inn
I know she don't drink, she said that she drink, I let her just sip what she can
I say, ""Lil' Ben, you hear them talkin'?"" He say ""Uh-uh""

Ran up my money, and they hear it when I talk now
Them bitches know it's over with, they in my past
'Cause you left ice on my heart
And I could say that ho wasn't wrong, you wasn't right from the start
I wish you could exchange my time for that watch that I bought
Really was tryna make you mine, I don't know what I had thought

Ayy, from my mans to my kids to myself
I say he forever capitalize off pain
Main nigga, big Rollie, big pistol
Top shotta, don dada, fuckin' gravedigger
We let them shots off at you and whoever came with you
While I'm takin' off, equip my brothers, that's a gang missile

Stripes
Nigga, I'm official, fuckin' a whistle, nigga
Life
They gon' have to give me, 'fore I let a nigga take mine, I'ma kill a hundred niggas
They say I'm remindin' niggas of Pac
Keep playin' around on that camera phone, they gon' find a nigga he shot
Dead, they call that FaceTime, nigga
Stay out the way, but I'll shake your whole gang 'fore you shake mine, nigga
Solo, pushin' the buggy in the store with the tool
And I'm pullin' up Lamborghini, pickin' up my daughter from school
We grew up fast paced, no big homies to show us the rules
I be havin' bad days when I don't want to take no photos, I'm rude
Like move
Ten times outta ten, if you ever see me, I be clutchin'
I'ma let it slang and pray to God, show me forgiveness when he judge me
I'ma try to aim that bitch between a nigga ears, he ever touch me
Can't trust a ho, even if these bitches really think they love me
Long as you know, never let a pussy nigga give me nothin'
Nowadays, a nigga really gettin' money, I remember back when
I told them niggas put me on, had to run it up on my own
They was actin' like they ain't hear a nigga
Now even when I'm right, a nigga wrong
Now these niggas wan' see me gone
It's probably 'cause I'm a real nigga
I told them niggas put me on, had to run it up on my own
They was actin' like they ain't hear a nigga
Now even when I'm right, a nigga wrong
Now these niggas wan' see me gone

See the finish line in my eye, I pray to God I make it
My soul belongs to my family, I can't let 'em take it
So if I live or die, just know forever, we the greatest
Modifications on the engine, I'ma hit it
Even if it save or it take my life, yeah
I'ma go all out with the ones I came in with
We stand tall if it's wrong or right, right (Right)

Bring 'em to the stand, have a shootout inside this club (Yeah)
I took too many Xans, I flipped this bitch who even mugged (Brrt)
She told me that she can't f*** with me, I approached her like a thug (Huh?)
Plus she probably looked up in my face and seen I'm full of drugs (Yeah)

Choppa make a sound effect (Gah, gah)
I come from Section 8, got eight hundred around my neck
Hellcat take me to the jet, bought foreign cars so I can flex
A simple text could end with sex, I'm tryna set the mood
My Trackhawk run off racing fuel, I'm drivin' like a fool
They see my drip, then hold they breath, then dive in like a pool
If I got one shot, then I'ma blow it (Blow it)
They want what I got, yeah, I'm knowin' (Yeah, I'm knowin')
Pull up in the drop while he snorin' (How he snorin')

Hol' up, I just stepped out in Givenchy boots
I let my doors up, look hard, you'll see that Draco in the coupe
Young ***** froze up, with a ** from out of state, look like Malu
I got the door stuck, too many killers with me, comin' through
Make me blow your a**, you try to act, I show your a**
And I won't let you slide, you shouldn't have tried, I get you smashed
And I been on the rise, I'm goin' too high, I don't wanna crash
Bitch, look up in my eyes, I don't give a ****, I'm really that

Alright, but life was hard
Grew up, got smart, but still gon' murder still

Crack the window, barrel stickin' out, it's stick 'em up

For to make the hard times look pretty

I watched my grandpa save pennies
I wish my grandma was right here standin' on side of me
Had to go through sad times to get it
And I know my son's gon' be aight, we all gon' be aight
'Cause I came 'bout my business
Let go my past, I'm movin' on, everything new, ain't nothin' old
Plenty jewelry, way too many cars, and I just bought myself a home
I still can't think why anybody would just leave me
Pistol sparkin', tryna drill these pussies out where I see
How the fuck you want me, but you hide me?
I'ma head home 'cause now you way up out of my league
Would get you tatted so just like her, you'll stand on side me
Dreams through the storm, I hope a smile always what kind see
Fail to see your greatness once they blind me
And that nigga must ain't poppin' it off, you talkin' that shit on Twitter
I'ma stay my dog ass in my ways, steady screamin', ""Fuck a nigga""

Thank God every card I got in my pocket hold at least one million

I love my baby boy, he the wind beneath my wings
CT Lee and lil' Kendell, man, he give them anything
See, your star up in the sky, but see, our star, she on our team
I'm sleepin' through the day because I'm livin' out my dream
And my mama on his side, she the angel on the scene
He goin' to the top because he win by any means
He married to this shit, he bought hisself a wedding ring
I just bought a brand-new bezel
For to make the hard times look pretty
And I came up straight up from the block
I watched my grandpa save pennies

Know you might not feel quite the same way

Like it's a crime, on trial, I got acquitted
