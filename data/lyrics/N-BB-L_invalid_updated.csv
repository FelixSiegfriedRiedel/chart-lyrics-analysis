The title is a mathematical expression that is equivalent to 69, which is the name of a sexual position referenced by the lust-themed song. This also acts as a play on the album’s and its lead single’s title.

In this song, Ariana sings about having a large sex drive and intending to have intercourse with her partner “all night long.”

An official remix was released on January 15, 2021, with new contributions from singer/rapper Doja Cat, and rapper Megan Thee Stallion.","[('Math class\n Never was good', [['Ariana jokingly ends the song with the fact that she sucks at math, undermining the sexual bravado in the majority of the song.\n\nHowever, she tweeted in 2010 that she actually likes math class (perhaps sarcastically).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/8911319286']]), ('You such a dream come true, true\n Make a bitch wanna hit snooze, ooh', [['Ariana refers to her lover as a dream, similar to lyrics from her 2018 song R.E.M.\n\nBefore you speak, don’t move\n‘Cause I don’t wanna wake up\nWake up, wake up, wake up\nDon’t wanna wake up, oh\nWake up, wake up, wake up\nBoy, you’re such a dream\nIf you can believe, babe\nBoy, you’re such a dream to me']]), ('You might think I’m crazy\n The way I’ve been cravin’\n If I put it quite plainly\n Just gimme them babies', [[""Ariana and one of her choreographers, Scott Nicholson, wrote these lines. On the album’s day of release, a fan on Twitter asked about Scott’s involvement with the song, to which Ariana replied:\n\noh the best night of my life\nhe brought us all the gift that is the “gimme them babies” line\n\nIn an interview with the Zach Sang Show, she explained how the writing session went down:\n\nI was like what comes after ‘You might think I’m crazy / The way I’ve been cravin’ / If I put it quite plainly' and Scott was like ‘Just give me them babies’. He said that he was joking and I was like ‘No, no, no, we’re doing it, it’s done, it’s perfect’. It came up as a total joke and then I fell in love with it.\n\nIn a statement for Genius, Scott said:\n\nTo have a songwriting credit on the album is a dream come true. And on such a fun, cheeky song. Her and her team have made history, and continue to do so, and it’s a blessing to be a part of the team.""]]), ('Even though I’m wifey, you can hit it like a side chick', [['To refer to a female partner as “wifey” indicates a long-term relationship. Oftentimes, the sex life of long-term partners tend to wind down after time as one or both partners lose interest in sex, engage in sexual activity less frequently, or get set into a routine. For these reasons, people may cheat and seek sexual encounters outside of their relationships.\n\nHowever, Ariana assures her partner that they would not have to cheat because she would keep sex as interesting and exciting as if she was a new, secret lover.\n\nAriana first admitted being “wifey” back on her 2018 song “borderline”:\n\nYou know I’m the wifey type, babe\n\nThis line also might be referencing her song “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored”, in which Ariana suggests she’ll let her love interest hit it even though he’s in a relationship.']]), ('Got the neighbors yellin’ “Earthquake!” (Earthquake)\n 4.5 when I make the bed shake', [['The Richter scale measures the strength of earthquakes, ranging from magnitudes of one through ten. Ariana and her partner rock the bed so much during sex that it causes a 4.5, which is considered to be a moderate earthquake.\n\nIn an interview with the Zach Sang Show, Ariana shared that she wrote these lyrics after experiencing an earthquake earlier in 2020:\n\nIt was the night after the big earthquake, scared the shit out of me, and I was like ‘4.5 when I make the bed shake.’ That’s why that lyric is there.\n\nThe earthquake she mentions is either the magnitude 4.2 earthquake on July 30, or the magnitude 4.5 earthquake on September 18, both of which shook throughout Southern California and Los Angeles, where Grande resides.']]), ('Watchin’ movies, but we ain’t seen a thing tonight (Yeah)', [['Grande implies that the movie is background noise while she’s having sex with her partner. This is also a play on Netflix and chill, which itself is a euphemism for sex.\n\nAriana used a similar line on May 2016’s “Moonlight,” from her album Dangerous Woman:\n\nAnd the movie is playing, but we won’t be watching tonight']]), ('Can you stay up all night?\n Fuck me ’til the daylight\n Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n Can you stay up all night? (All night)\n Fuck me ’til the daylight\n Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)', [[""34 and 35 amount to 69—a sexual position in which both partners experience oral pleasure during sex. The ‘6’ and the ‘9’ are intended to resemble inverted sexual partners lying on each other.\n\nAriana instructs her partner to use the position while having sex. It’s also a more overt reference to the sexual subtext from the lead single, “positions”:\n\nSwitchin' the positions for you\nCookin' in the kitchen and I’m in the bedroom\n\nWhen discussing these lines in an interview with The Zach Sang Show, Ariana said:\n\nThe whole ‘Fuck me 'til the daylight’ thing is like… ridiculous. Because I’m tired after one, and it’s time to go to bed. For me it’s a total façade, it’s bullshit.

En la canción, ambos intérpretes describen a una mujer con la que recientemente tuvieron un romance, pero ella desconoce y se desentiende del contexto en que se conocieron: en una fiesta y bailando reggaetón.

The R&B record finds both artists tapping into their melodic sides as they sing about a girl who’s “got it.”

The collaboration was initially teased by Chris on his Instagram stories and later previewed at a nightclub during Chris' 30th birthday party.

Despite having been at odds previously—due to an incident at a nightclub in June 2012—the two artists reconciled in 2018 via Instagram and later on stage when Drake brought Chris out at his L.A. tour stop.","[('Way they hittin’ you, the DM lookin’ violent', [[""The phrase to “hit on” is slang for talking with someone you’re sexually attracted to. Some start these conversations with potential partners by “DMing” them on an app called Instagram.

Since so many people are sexually “hittin'” on this girl, he remarks that the her Instagram “DMs” must be filled with physical “violence” from all the slaps.""]]), ('You a lil’ hot girl, you a lil’ sweetie (No, sweet)\n Sweet like Pearland, sweet like Peachtree (Like that)', [[""Here Drake makes a reference to rapper Megan Thee Stallion who also goes by “Hot Girl Meg.” In the following line, Drake mentions Pearland, which is a city in the Houston area where Megan grew up.

When he says, “you a lil' sweetie,” it also intentionally sounds like “you a lil' sweet tea.” Drake makes a subtle reference by telling the girl that just like the drink, he thinks that she is also very “sweet.”\n\nDrake is known for dropping locations in various different songs, even including many locations within the song title, such as “9AM in Dallas,” “4PM in Calabasas,” and “6PM in New York.”""]]), ('Flew the coop at 17, no guidance', [['“Flew the coop” means to escape a place that limits freedom.

Most of Gunna’s tracks contain smooth guitar melodies (including this one) so Gunna refers to himself as a rockstar. He has also explicitly referred to himself as such on “ROCKSTAR BIKERS AND CHAINS”.\n\nOther notable tracks of his that include guitar melodies include:\n\n\nGunna, “Sold Out Dates” (Apr. 2018)\n\nTravis Scott, “YOSEMITE” (Aug. 2018)\n\nLil Baby & Gunna, “Drip Too Hard” (Sep. 2018)\n\nTory Lanez,  “MiAMi” (Oct. 2018)\nGunna, “Same Yung Nigga” (Feb. 2019)\n\nLil Mosey, “Stuck In A Dream” (Sep. 2019)\n\nRoddy Ricch, “Start wit Me” (Oct. 2019)\n\nA Boogie wit da Hoodie, “Numbers” (Feb. 2020)\nGunna, “WUNNA” & “MET GALA” (May 2020)\n\nPop Smoke, “Paranoia” (Jul. 2020)\nGunna, “NOTHING 4 FREE” (Jul. 2020)\nGunna, “DIRTY DIANA” (Jul. 2020)\n\n\n\nGunna’s virtual “Wunna Live in LA” concert also included him rapping over a live band that had a heavy emphasis on guitars.\n\nFurthermore, Wockhardt Ltd. is a pharmaceutical company from Mumbai, India.

The codeine in the cough syrup is known to cause feelings of lightness and euphoria, especially when taken in quantities greater than prescribed.']]), ('I got water on me, yeah, everything on Fiji', [['In this case, “water” refers to expensive jewelry because of their clarity. It is a popularized term in hip-hop music, such as on NAV’s March 2019 track, “Hold Your Breath,” in which he says:\n\nDiamonds water, you wear my chain, gotta hold your breath (Breath)\n\n\n\nInterestingly, NAV rapped about Molly, name-dropping Fiji water to show he was only talking about the Molly water on his feature on Travis Scott’s September 2016 hit track, “beibs in the trap,” in which he says:\n\nTold Frost bring the water, no Fiji\n\n“Water” also has a broader definition; it could be referring to his “drip,” or simply his clothing. Water is wet so it drips, and “drip” is a slang term for expensive or fashionable clothing.']]), ('Got a penthouse near Rodeo off of stress (Stress)', [['Rodeo Drive is a famous street in Beverly Hills, California, known for its three block stretch of luxury goods stores. Many celebrities and rich people live on or near the street, such as American model and media personality Kylie Jenner and fellow Canadian singer Justin Bieber.

At the time of this single’s release, he had recently gotten earrings again. He can be seen wearing them on the official music video for his friend Trav’s July 2020 single “Pradaaa Shoes,”, which he was featured on.\n\n\n\nVVS is an acronym for Very, Very Slightly [Included], a score, representing the clarity of expensive jewelry. These earrings are clearly VVS. The “two karats” refers to the gold in the earrings, as karats are a unit used to measure gold.']]), ('Lips sealed, I ain’t pillow talkin’, I’m no rat (No)', [['This could be a reference to fellow rapper 6ix9ine and his trial in 2019, in which he testified against the members of his former gang, the Nine Trey Bloods and received a 2-year sentence, with credit for 13 months already served, with 11 more months to serve. However, 6ix9ine was released 4 months early due to his asthma, which made him more vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\nThis incident led rappers and fans to coin the term “rat,” which is also a slang term for “snitch.” In this case, based on the previous line, NAV is stating about having drugs and money in his bag. Hence, he has his lips sealed and will not tell anybody so he or his crew will not get caught, most likely by police.\n\nAdditionally, in a virtual Instagram Live interview with Bootleg Kev on May 8, 2020, NAV stated he would never work with 6ix9ine because he will not get rid of his “human values.”']]), ('And that’s on my government name (Nah)', [['Gunna’s legal ‘government’ (birth/legal name) is Sergio Giavanni Kitchens.\n\nSwearing on “your government name” means you swear to never change the view you’re swearing on.

Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues, Lord, those images hauntin'

Bassmasters, look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol

At times, it be feelin' the devil be winnin' but do that mean God lost?
Just got off the phone with my nigga, he back in the kennel, my dog lost
I brought him 'round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be
I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind
It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries
My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency
Said, ""Most of these niggas gon' hang themselves, just give 'em the rope and see""
Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me
Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back
Unfortunately we seen the trap

Two days before releasing the song, Cole published an essay titled “The Audacity” in which he discussed several critical periods of his life and the persistent obligation to achieve his goals. He specifically utilized the word ‘climb’ to describe how he advanced himself in each of these periods, which can be seen as a prelude to this song.

This and “Lion King on Ice” were intended to be the first two singles from Cole’s seventh studio album, The Fall Off. They were released together as the two-track Lewis Street.

On May 12, 2021, “The Climb Back” was reformatted to “t h e c l i m b b a c k” on streaming services. The following day, it was confirmed that it would now be included as a track on The Off-Season, instead of its original placement on The Fall Off, making it the LP’s lead single. The periods weren’t added to the title until the album’s release.","[('Everything come back around full circle', [['J Cole uses this chorus to paint across dualities: lies v truth; cry v smile; life v coming back from the dead; night v light.\n\nAnd yet all of this begins this with things coming back around full circle?\n\nIt’s because a sine wave is derived from the movement of a point around a circle. Because the nature of our existence is essentially circular (we orbit the Sun, the Moon orbits us, electrons in an atom orbit the nucleus), we experience life in sine waves.\n\nSo, Cole’s chorus is saying the dualities of life are caused by the circular nature of reality.']]), ('At times, it be feelin’ the devil be winnin’ but do that mean God', [['it’s about god fighting the devil and banishing him']]), ('Now I know why they call it blue moon (Yeah', [['The next Blue Moon is August 22 2021.\n\nhttps://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/when-is-the-next-blue-moon/']]), ('Or they gon’ for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code', [['J Cole references the term “promo code” which typically advertises purchasing an item with a discount.\n\nIn this verse, he may be referring to individuals fatally shooting someone.']]), ('Tryna find the derivative', [[""This line can be interpreted in a mathematical sense, as finding the derivate is a part of differential calculus.\n\nThe first derivative of a mathematical function tells us the gradient of the function, or how steep/flat it is.\n\nCole uses this meaning to craft some nifty wordplay with the previous line “the steepest of mountains, they tryin' to climb”.\n\nCole talks about how he is not trying to climb this mountain, instead showing his wit by simply calculating the derivative.""]]), ('Well, I ain’t with that sleepin’ underground like a gopher, so I go for mines', [[""This is a play on the homophone words “gopher” and “go-for”.

Whether they are together or apart, she makes him absolutely crazy.

Khalid described the John Mayer collaboration as a matter of chance:

On this song, Lil Durk reminisces on his old life in the streets in a sad tone, dropping lines about sexual activity, legal issues, and weapons. While rapping on the two verses, Durk sings with a robotic auto-tune on the chorus.

The collaboration was first teased on November 11, 2019, in an Instagram live stream before being debuted a few hours later at Travis' ASTROWORLD FESTIVAL, alongside Migos and Thug for the first live performance.

It serves as the second single for Post Malone’s 2019 album, Hollywood’s Bleeding, and is part of the soundtrack for the 2018 animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The track would end up breaking the record for most weeks spent in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart after notching its 45th week.

Sunflowers are a symbol of loyalty and longevity because of the flower’s ability to retain its beauty in the face of environmental factors that would leave other flowers wilted. The sunflower in this song represents a girl—a woman who’s shown persistence, despite a lack of affection shown to her. However, sunflowers also deplete nutrients from soil much quicker than other plants and can inhibit the growth of other plants. Post Malone’s verses could imply that the person he’s with is in constant need of help and attention, yet he is unable to tend to them as much as they would like.

This mystery girl ends up being the subject matter for both Post Malone and Swae Lee. In their verses, the girl seems to be trying much harder in the relationship than either of the two stars. However, even after all of the poor treatment the girl has received, she remains by Post and Swae’s side.

Post first teased the song at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on October 1, 2018. He then confirmed on Facebook that the song would include Swae Lee. Two snippets from the lyric video were shown on both of their Instagram accounts on October 15, 2018.","[('Then you’re left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya\n You’re a sunflower, I think your love would be too much\n Or you’ll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya\n You’re the sunflower, you’re the sunflower', [['“Sunflower” is Miles Morales‘ favorite song; he sings it throughout Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\n\n\n\nSunflowers are known to rapidly deplete their soil of nutrients.

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

""Happy Christmas"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you"", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears (Ohh)
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Special...
Someone, someone, I'll give it to someone, someone special

Who give me something in return
I'll give it to someone—
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay (Oh, oh)
How could you love me for a day
I thought you were someone special
Gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
You gave it away
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—

The single was released at 12PM ET on September 29, 2020 just two days after the band’s four-year anniversary.

Interestingly, Why Don’t We featured a song called “Falling” on the debut album, 8 Letters, released in 2018. Upon the release of “Fallin'”, the track named was changed to “Can’t You See” on streaming services.

On October 23, 2020, the song’s title was changed to “Fallin' (Adrenaline)” on streaming services to further distinguish itself from “Can’t You See.”

In theory, it should work as means for consistent forward movement for the animal.\n\nPut into the human context, this allegory serves to express J-Hope’s source of motivation in moving forward in his life, career, and altogether in constant artistic growth. Saying “the carrots are on the trophies” points to how awards and achievements (especially ones significant to his career), oftentimes literally trophies, are one out of many motivations he may have in moving forward and flourishing.\n\nThe expression of “whipping oneself” is a way to describe how one could be exceptionally hard on themselves, whether it be with full self-discipline or self-motivation to accelerate in completing a certain task. It is much like how a coachman of a carriage uses a whip on the horses upfront to increase or maintain speed.\nSo basically j-Hope conveys the point that he’s always ‘whipping himself’, or pushing himself forward toward those ‘carrots’ (The trophies which signify success and victory) through several means of hard work, self-enforced discipline and strict practice, which he relates to the word ‘whip’, an instantaneous slash of pain.\n\nIt is with these two interconnected metaphors he expresses his solemn, earnest drive to constantly grow as an individual and make progress to walk further down the road.']])]","['', 'OMG !!! 😄\nThis song is sooo amazing !!! 😘😍\nWho loves our cute , caring and talented J – Hope ???\n👇🏻', 'one of the best collabs this year', 'HOPE ON THE SUMMİT!! 🔥', 'the song of the year uwur', 'last time i was was this early to a release, mcr was still together', 'This song is A BOP!!', 'Eh yooo!! hope world!!!', 'oh its k pop', '🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥hit', 'I love ittttt !

In November 2018, A$AP Rocky appeared at the LACMA Art+Film Gala in Los Angeles, wearing a $495 Gucci babushka.

Rocky revealed more details about the fashion choice—and the inspiration for the song—in January 2019. Apparently, the decision stemmed from a desire to hide a cut on his face, which he touches on throughout the song’s lyrics, referencing the classic 1983 gangster film Scarface. In January 2019, he told GQ magazine:

[The song] was inspired by a situation I had where my face got cut, and I started walking around with a babushka to cover it. It was about last September. It started with a yellow one when I was on Trevor Noah’s show. I actually did a Vogue shoot the day after I got my face slashed.

Rocky first previewed “Babushka Boi” during his 2019 Injured Generation tour.","[('Benjis in the safe (That’s right, ayy)', [['Benji is short for Benjamin Franklin.\n\nThe name is commonly used to refer to the US one hundred-dollar bill, in reference to the use of Franklin’s portrait on the print.']]), ('Praise to the Lord, give him grace', [['A callback to Flacko’s May 2018 hit “Praise the Lord (Da Shine)” featuring Skepta off his album TESTING:\n\nGive thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless']]), ('Uh, pearls and diamonds, that’s excessive', [['In February 2019, Rocky used this line as his caption on an Instagram post while out on his Injured Generation tour.

The term can also be used to describe a big scar on someones face, often from one corner of the mouth to the ear. The term originates from getting this wound stitched up with at least 150 stitches.\n\nIn September 2018, Rocky was cut on the face and it had to be covered, for which he used a babushka. “Babushka” is Russian meaning “grandmother” or “elderly woman,” but the term is also used to describe a Russian headscarf that is traditionally worn under the chin by elderly Eastern European women.\n\nIn a January 2019 interview with GQ, Rocky talked more about it:\n\nIt started with a yellow one when I was on Trevor Noah’s show. I actually did a Vogue shoot the day after I got my face slashed. […] It was inspired by Alfalfa—you ever see the Little Rascals, when he pretended to have a toothache?

The song is about a relationship that didn’t went well but overall (said by G-Eazy in a interview) its about getting related to missing someone or something.
This features the long time collaborator blackbear who the two have worked together on songs such as Remember You.

This song was announced in early 2020 with a feature from late rapper Juice WRLD, however his feature was removed when the song released officially possibly due to his label wanting to use his verse for one of his many upcoming posthumous songs.

“These Things Happen Too” is the sequel of his 2014 success album “These Things Happen”. We will probably get back an old G-Eazy, with nostalgic songs like this single.
We already teased the album by doing as blackbear feature like he did on the presequel.","[('Hate the way you talkin’ when you with your friends, too\n Yeah, they don’t know about the shit we’ve been through\n I said I hate the fucking way I always', [['Gerald: “ This  song does not offer a solution.

Sip from the bottle for shit that we bottlin' in
Goin' live, but we not on the 'Gram
This the land of supply and demand
Where my young niggas choppin' up grams
And them choppers won't pry from they hands
Packin' lead like they got a exam
If it's beef, my niggas look just like homewreckers
They got they eye on your mans
I pray to God that it jam
Too many done died in these parts
So we gotta be smart if we tryna see August
Some niggas won't make it past summer regardless
I'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits
These niggas be lookin' at me like I got it
Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke
As that nigga who just graduated from college
Scrapin' up change that got left in my pockets
I'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar
Ridin' the train, way too shy to go holler
Just watched her get off at her stop, I'm a coward
Fuck it, though, you got a way bigger target
I'ma do it so big, they won't know what to call it
Sound like a whole Lambo' truck in my stomach
Bitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving
Gotta move mama from out them apartments
Gotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten
Gotta hit hoes you hang up in your locker
Gotta get rich, 'cause my granny picked cotton
Gotta make hits, 'cause if not, then I'm floppin'
Gotta stay me in the process
Niggas dissed me, it was nonsense
I sat 'em down like his father
My nigga asked, ""Why you bother?
We should've caught him and mobbed him""
I said, ""We gotta move smarter""
Don't wan' be the reason for one more sad song
I tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long
I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit, but they made they attempts
May have a good year like that name on the blimp
But you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price
Young Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God
Half the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?
But that's treacherous, that shows less of us
I need y'all to see every part of me
Every scar and every artery
Every story that I can recall, then I can fall

I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie (Uh)

Lately, I reflect on the times a nigga was low
I got it up off the floor, I'm stronger than ever before
I'm stronger than ever before just like I planned to be
They wanna see me fold, it ain't no thang to me
Thoughts when I was broke, if only I could be
Pockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me
At night, I hit my knees, I prayed for better days
Then found a better me, I got my head on straight

Up, up, and away, just ridin' my wave, I ain't never gon' say nothin'
Nigga throw a shot my way, I just jot down names, ain't never gon' say nothin'

Know that it's destined83EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/J-cole-lion-king-on-ice-lyrics,5788895,J. Cole,"On “Lion King on Ice,” J. Cole reverts to his alter ego, Young Simba, but now in a much colder and darker tone. He raps about his come-up and his experience growing up in Fayetteville, where he wasn’t always certain that he would see the next day. He furthers this by reflecting on the challenges he has endured in his career and realizing that his fame and wealth haven’t erased the trauma of his past.

Parts of the song are rapped from the perspective of a young Cole, as he raps about needing to prove himself and rise to the top of the rap game, both of which the current Cole has already accomplished.

Two days before releasing this song, Cole published an essay titled “The Audacity” in which he discussed how the feeling of needing to prove himself is what drove him when he first began rapping:

When I started rapping, it was the competition that drove me. I had a burning desire to be the best in the world and to prove it with every verse.

This and “The Climb Back” were initially the first two singles from Cole’s album, The Fall Off, and were released together as Lewis Street. However, the latter was relocated to The Off-Season in May 2021.","[('Goin’ live, but we not on the ’Gram', [['“Goin’ live” here seems to refer to a concert or new endeavor. However, Cole explicitly states that he is not referring to going live on Instagram.\n\nInterestingly, Cole has been on Instagram Live only one time. It occurred on January 24, 2019, the day after he released “MIDDLE CHILD.” He joined the Live of his Dreamville signee, Ari Lennox, and the two conversed for about five minutes before Cole logged off. He actually had difficulty leaving the session, noting that he had never done it before.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8JoEI8IPsY']]), ('Pockets holdin’ hope', [[""“Pockets holdin' hope” literally is saying that the only thing that Cole had to his name at that time was hope, only a dream of what one day he could/wanted to be. Interesting is that he says that it’s his pockets that are “holding” hope, which means that his life at that point was so low that even his very pockets had to grab on and barely was holding on to the little hope he had at the time.\n\nA similiar line was also said by JAY-Z back in 2001 on his song Renegade,\n“Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope”\n\nin the same way Cole reflects on his tough past and upbringing, that one day would fill his pockets with much more than just hope.""]]), ('Where my young niggas choppin’ up grams\n And them choppers won’t pry from they hands\n Packin’ lead like they got a exam', [['Throughout this song, Cole raps about his teenage years. Here, he talks about some of his friends that became involved in the gangster lifestyle, where they were “choppin’ up grams” (managing drugs) and wielding “choppers” (guns).\n\nCole creates a double entendre when discussing his friends “packin’ lead.” It literally refers to the lead ammunition for their guns, but Cole ties this to the mention of an “exam” because the graphite within pencils is often (and wrongly) referred to as “lead.” Of course, pencils are the required utensil for most examinations.']]), ('Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke\n As that nigga who just graduated from college', [['J. Cole graduated from St. John’s University in Queens, New York in 2007, earning magna cum laude honors and accruing a 3.82 GPA over his tenure. He detailed his college lifestyle in his May 2007 track, “College Boy,” which was released right as he was graduating from school.\n\nCole spoke about his financial situation post-graduation in an interview with Interview Magazine in February of 2013:\n\nAh, man. Well, actually, I graduated magna cum laude. And after college, man, that was… Well, I was broke as hell. I was renting an apartment in Queens with my roommates during school, and after we graduated, they moved out and started their careers. I didn’t really have a career at that point[…] Well, I was hitting my mom up for money. I kept hitting other people up for money, too. I just felt like a bum. I owed thousands of dollars in rent and I was just waiting on my deal. My landlord was always letting me slide, but eventually I had to give him something, even just to show that I had income. So my homie hooked me up with this job at a newspaper.\n\nCole hasn’t forgotten that part of his life, however. He remains close with his aforementioned landlord, Mohammad, and even paid him back his missed rent and some once he got his deal.']]), ('Sound like a whole Lambo’ truck in my stomach\n Bitch, I ain’t hungry, this feeling is starving', [['Cole reflects on his past when he was broke and couldn’t afford to eat. He was hungry to the point his stomach rumbled so loud that it sounded like a Lambo truck. The car in question is the Lamborghini Urus, Lamborghini being a luxury sports car manufacturer known for it’s fast and deafening loud cars.\n\n“LamboTruck” was also a song on J. Cole’s label, Dreamville’s, 2019 album Revenge of the Dreamers III. In the song, Dreamville Records signee Cozz goes on to say that Cole actually drives a Lamborghini Urus:\n\nCole just pulled up in a Lamborghini truck\n\nJ. Cole continues this verse by speaking on how he needs to stay dedicated to finally make it. Therefore, the double-meaning of these bars is that Cole was not only hungry for success, but starving for it, and kept working until he finally got the Lambo truck that may have been foreshadowed in his past. Coincidentally, a theme throughout “LamboTruck” is being hungry as a young artist, which can be seen in Cozz’s lyrics:\n\nI just ate, but still I’m hungry\n\nand\n\nNigga, this hunger got me finna choke\n\n\n\n\nThe Laborghini Urus in the “LamboTruck” music video']]), ('Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin’ advice\n Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God', [['At the current stage of his career, Cole is known for his modesty and reserved persona. Some even say that Cole dresses like he’s homeless, something that Dreamville signee JID played off of in a skit on his November 2018 song, “Workin Out”:\n\nWhy that nigga J. Cole got all this money [but] look like he ‘bout to borrow somebody charger or something?\n\nHowever, when Cole was still a rising artist, he often chose to dress like “the traditional rapper,” wearing expensive jewelry and clothing.\n\n\n\nThe most notable instance of this was Cole’s outfit at the 2013 BET Awards, pictured above. After two other artists wore the exact same thing, it became a public spectacle of “Who Wore It Best?”\n\nCole recalled this in his March 2019 GQ interview. He said that he wanted to wear something else, but the people around him were trying to convince him that the Versace sweater and chain were the things that would make him be perceived as a superstar, which is what he was longing for at the time.\n\nUltimately, this didn’t work out the way that Cole or those people had thought, which is part of why he came to the realization that he was doing things to impress others rather than being himself. From that point, he made a notable shift in his public persona that still persists. He doesn’t want to be defined by materialistic things or be perceived as vain. He also notes that he had to find God, which indicates that the glorification of wealth within the music industry may have initially deterred his relationship with Him.\n\nInterestingly, less than two weeks before the award show, Cole had discussed his negative perception of materialism on his record, “Chaining Day.” It has also been discussed in several interviews and songs since the June 2013 event.']]), ('Half the time, we be pacifyin’, what they expect from us?\n But that’s treacherous, that shows less of us\n I need y’all to see every part of me\n Every scar and every artery\n Every story that I can recall, then I can fall', [['Cole talks about what he needs to complete before he can officially retire, or “fall.” He is telling his fans that instead of only giving listeners what they are expecting from him, he’s going to be completely transparent and tell as many stories as he can recall.\n\nSince Cole unveiled the album’s title in April of 2018, fans theorized that The Fall Off was titled this way because it would be Cole’s final album and the start of his retirement. However, he had teased possibly retiring nearly two years prior on DJ Khaled’s July 2016 record, “Jermaine’s Interlude,” rapping:\n\nSaid all that I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement\n\nCole is now contradicting his previous stance as he realizes that there is more that he can divulge to his listeners.\n\nTwo days before releasing this song, Cole published an essay titled “The Audacity” in which he discussed several critical periods of his life. He also wrote on the times that he contemplated retirement before ultimately deciding against it. In the essay’s final paragraph, he wrote:\n\nOn my career bucket list, there remain a few more items to check off before I give myself permission to enter whatever the next chapter of my life may be.\n\nIt is still unknown whether or not The Fall Off will be Cole’s final album, but he seems to be preparing for the final stages of his career.\n\n“Scar” could be connecting this line to the 1994 film, The Lion King, which inspired Cole’s alter ego and is where this song’s title is derived from. The movie’s main antagonist is a lion named Scar, so Cole could be saying that he wants to show his fans his darker side.']]), ('Niggas dissed me, it was nonsense\n I sat ’em down like his father\n My nigga asked, ”Why you bother?\n We should’ve caught him and mobbed him”\n I said, “We gotta move smarter”\n Don’t wan’ be the reason for one more sad song\n I tried to warn niggas they wouldn’t last long\n I hope that you see how they came and they went\n They shots never hit, but they made they attempts', [[""J. Cole calls back to his songs that have ridiculed the new wave of rappers, like his December 2016 track, “everybody dies,” and his April 2018 song, “1985.”\n\n“1985” is the most notable; it was made in response to a trend of fans jokingly chanting, “Fuck J. Cole,” that was started by two Miami rappers, Lil Pump and Smokepurpp. The trend became quite popular and was even the title of a now-scrapped song by Pump. Cole eventually caught wind of what he perceived as disrespect, leading him to discuss his opinion on Pump and other artists like him. On one part of the song, Cole raps:\n\nI’m just tellin' you what’s probably gon' happen when you rappin'\n‘Bout the type of shit you rappin’ ‘bout\nIt’s a faster route to the bottom\nI wish you good luck\nI’m hoping for your sake that you ain’t dumb as you look\nBut if it’s really true what people sayin’\nAnd you call yourself playin' with my name\nThen I really know you fucked, trust\nI’ll be around forever ‘cause my skills is tip-top\nTo any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked\nJust remember what I told you when your shit flop\nIn five years, you gon’ be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga\n\nFollowing the song’s release, Cole and Lil Pump had an endearing conversation at Cole’s home in which they discussed the “Fuck J. Cole” situation and more. However, this didn’t stop Pump from falling off as Cole had predicted. Pump’s second album, released in February 2019, was critically panned and sold only 48,000 units in its first week. Pump will likely never regain the amount of attention or success that he had when he rose to stardom in 2017.\n\nOne of the other rappers that Cole was speaking to on “1985” is Pump’s friend, Smokepurpp. He has also evidently fallen off; his last release before this song, June 2020’s Florida Jit, sold slightly over 4,700 units in its first week.\n\nCole is also saying that he had the fatherly sit-down with Pump because he didn’t want to feel guilty if Pump had died a young death due to the topics of his raps.""]]), ('I got mud on my shoes, I ain’t gon’ lie', [['While this chorus and song seem to be rapped from the perspective of a young Cole, this bar calls back to a line from January 2019’s “MIDDLE CHILD,” where Cole raps:\n\nThe Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty\nBut that’s how I like it, you all on my dick\n\nFiguratively, the mud on his shoes alludes to having “come from the dirt,” a slang term akin to the ghetto or slums. This ties into the young persona that Cole takes on throughout the song.']]), ('May have a good year like that name on the blimp\n But you know what it takes to be poppin’ this long?\n Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life\n Celebratin’ all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price', [['Continuing the above lines about the artists that try to diss him, Cole then alludes to the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, particularly the company’s famous blimp.\n\n\n\nRappers like Lil Pump and Smokepurpp, who have dissed Cole, may have one “good year” of success (2017 for them), but their careers will ultimately fail to attain the same longevity that Cole’s career has. He offers the answer as to why: they don’t possess the same dedication and modesty.\n\nMany rappers, with varying career lengths, go broke because of wealth mismanagement, which can often include a lack of saving and a penchant for making unnecessary or reckless purchases. Cole suggests that celebrating after every minor accomplishment can be costly in the long run.']])]","['“I tried to warn niggas they wouldn’t last long”\nLil Pump felt that', 'waaaaaait, Young Simba is back, yessir!', 'Just wow !!', 'YOUNG SIMBA IS BACK.

Cole’s first offering of 2019 serves as a warning in advance of an extensive rollout of Dreamville material. On the track, Cole envisions himself in the center of the old and new generations of hip-hop, therefore making him the “middle child” of rap.

“Middle Child Syndrome” is a psychological condition in which middle children sometimes feel neglected by their families due to the attention that their younger and older siblings receive.","[('They poisoned the well', [['“Poisoning the well” is a logical fallacy in debate culture, where someone inserts a personal attack against the opponent into their argument.\n\nSimilarly, black kids face prejudice before being given a chance to reach adulthood. Distorted media coverage, discriminatory government policies, and high incarceration rates are just a few factors that stack the odds against them and create barriers to success.']]), ('Distorted self-image,', [['Whether it’s the music business or the government, the system always wants to put people (especially Black people and people of color) within their established stereotypes and styles, thus hiding the real image of who we are.']]), ('This year gon’ be different, I set my intentions\n I promise to slap all that hate out your voice', [['As of this song’s release, Cole is preparing to release The Off-Season, his fourth mixtape, Revenge of the Dreamers III, the third compilation by Dreamville Records, a currently untitled album under his “kiLL edward” alter ego, and The Fall Off, his sixth studio album.\n\nThe four projects mentioned above prove that 2019 is a different year for Cole, as he has never released more than one full-length project in a year.\n\nAfter this song released, Cole tweeted:\nhttps://twitter.com/JColeNC/status/1088584217951420416']]), ('You good, T-Minus?', [['Ontario, Canadian producer T-Minus co-produced this track with Cole.

My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some ""Fuck a retweet,"" most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, ""Wait""
He was like, ""Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real""
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today

Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin' to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive105EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/J-cole-snow-on-tha-bluff-lyrics,5678154,J. Cole,"“Snow on tha Bluff” is J. Cole’s first release of 2020. On the song, which is titled after a January 2011 film about a robbery in Atlanta, Cole delivers a single continuous verse that speaks on various issues facing the United States, including police brutality, wealth inequality, and racism. He also asks for his fans not to idolize him, wanting to instead be perceived as a regular person.

Although not explicitly stated, the first part of the track is likely a response to Noname’s perceived criticisms of Cole on Twitter. She has frequently stated that she is against capitalism and celebrity culture, two things that Cole raps about in his verse.

The artwork displays the beginning of the verse. The date at the top, June 4, 2020, likely indicates the day the song was written. This date is several days after Cole was seen protesting racial injustice in his hometown, Fayetteville, NC.","[('Can you walk with me?\n I hope we’ll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry\n Painful memories fuck up the vibe\n Though I be tryin’ to let the time heal my mind\n I was once a child, I’ve gotten older\n Still, I know I’m just a boy in God’s eyes\n Fill me up with wisdom and some courage\n Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive', [['In this outro Cole laments on feelings of despair and the disheartening nature of witnessing repeated tragedies–then offering that hopefully we can find the strength to continue in pursuit of change.  The first four lines asking someone to walk with him could be addressed to several different entities:\n\nA) The female referenced in the first part of the song\nB) The human population in general\nC) God\n\nA or B) Taken more literally, Cole may be asking the woman referenced in the song, or the human race as a whole to walk with him in pursuit of healing.  That through conversation they may be able to both process some of the deep sadness, and share knowledge so that everyone can become more educated.\n\nC) While the last four lines more exclusively comment on a higher perspective, the entire outro may be a conversation Cole is having with God.  Under this interpretation, Cole begins by asking if God can walk with him and try to explain some reason why these tragedies continue to occur.  Second, Cole comments on the relationship of time and healing: that times supposedly heals all wounds, but while he is now an adult, from God’s perspective he is still very young.  This may imply that he has a lot of healing left to be realized or more literally that from the perspective of an infinite being, Cole is young.  Lastly, Cole asks God to fill him with the wisdom, courage, and endurance to continue on fighting the good fight.']]), ('[Outro]', [['Cole’s singing voice has evolved with each stage of his career. Cole’s singing was notably heard on his December 2014 track, “Apparently.” He would be heard continuing to expand his vocal range on his December 2016 album, 4 Your Eyez Only, on songs like “Ville Mentality” and both parts of “She’s Mine.” Cole again sang on his April 2018 album, KOD, on songs like “Photograph” and “Kevin’s Heart.” On that album, he also began manipulating his voice using the alter-ego kill Edward.\n\nWith “Snow on tha Bluff,” Cole continues to expand his vocal range, singing in an unexpected falsetto as he harmonizes with his usual tone.']]), ('Now I ain’t no dummy to think I’m above criticism\n So when I see something that’s valid, I listen\n But shit, it’s something about the queen tone that’s botherin’ me\n She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment\n With parents that know ’bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with\n A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts ’em\n And the clearest understandin’ of what we gotta do to get free', [[""Continuing in his discussion of Chicago multi-genre artist Noname, Cole explains that she may have had a “head start” in her social awareness from an upbringing that incorporated education on Black liberation in America into the way she was raised.\n\nHowever, Noname has discussed her familial upbringing in multiple interviews during her career, and revealed that she grew up with her grandparents on the South Side of Chicago until she was 13 and after moved in with her mother. She delved deeply into her upbringing in a February 2017 interview with the Chicago Tribune:\n\n[My grandmother was] the woman who raised me until I was about 13, 14. My mother owned a bookstore, which she started when she was 24 (in 1991), the same age when she had me, and she ultimately didn’t have time to juggle both the store and raising me — she didn’t know how. She was young and a new entrepreneur, and for her it made sense for me to stay with my grandmother. I saw my mom on weekends. My grandparents had full custody, and my mom was like a visiting relative. Once things slowed down with my mother’s business, I moved back in with her. It was a little strange at first, there was a little resentment, because I took to my grandmother a little more. So when I moved in with my mother, it was a little awkward, but we’re good now.\n\nOne interesting part of her youth that Noname frequently addresses is her participation in the Chicago youth media group YOUmedia, where she met and befriended fellow Chicago rappers such as Chance the Rapper, Saba, Cam O'bi, and others. On her participation in the group, Noname said:\n\n[YOUmedia] was my safe place to create and feel understood in a lot of ways, to feel like I could create openly, with vulnerability and not to be judged or criticized… [The transition from poetry to rap] wasn’t hard — the environment was so filled with a variety of art forms. There would be someone singing, rapping, reading a poem, doing a short monologue or dancing — it was like a variety show. Being around a bunch of different people who were rapping, I felt like I could do both. We’d have these cyphers after each open mic.\n\nThe stories and perspectives that each of her fellow participants may have rubbed off on her during the youth program may have helped give her confidence in both her musical and social voice, allowing her to be as much of an advocate for change that she is now.""]]), ('I struggle with thoughts on the daily\n Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery\n Thinkin’ just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies\n I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I’m some kind of a hero\n Because of the zeros that’s next to the commas', [[""Cole yet again speaks on his disillusion with fame and money, a topic that he has broached numerous times throughout his career and discography. Here, he correlates himself to a slave and even says that he feels as though he has betrayed his black brothers and sisters who are not as fortunate.\n\nOn his December 2014 track, “Love Yourz,” Cole discusses how, after receiving wealth and fame, he realized that they were not all that it was made out to be. The entirety of the song discusses this, but here is a portion of the second verse:\n\nThink being broke was better\nNow I don’t mean that phrase with no disrespect\nTo all my niggas out there livin' in debt\nCashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex\nAnd fantasize about a life with no stress\nI mean this shit sincerely\nAnd as a nigga who was once in your shoes\nLivin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me\nAlways gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me\nLong as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly\n\nThis topic from Cole is most popularly known from his March 2015 interview with Tavis Smiley:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tr_9DozAok""]]), ('Shit, it’s a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed\n These shackles be lockin’ the mental way more than the physical\n I look at freedom like trees, can’t grow a forest like overnight\n Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin’ your seeds', [['While the exact timeline of slavery in the Americas is unknown, African slaves are estimated to have been first brought to America by Spanish and Portuguese settlers somewhere from 1501 – 1505. Slavery in America was officially abolished on December 18, 1865 by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, giving the total duration of slavery in the United States a range of 360 to 364 years.\n\nCole compares the physical shackles African slaves experience while coming to America to the restrictions that systemic racism in America have on the mindset of Black people in the country. Having been oppressed for the many years and having heard many stories of oppression from past generations, Cole says Black people in America are unable to believe that there is an escape from the subjugation that they experience in society, stressing the importance to free themselves from this restriction before further change can be made.\n\nCole then gives his own input on how education on racial discrimination and inequality should be undertaken in America, saying that it should be a gradual process and cannot be an undertaking completed overnight. He also says education on the topics in communities should start within the communities themselves, allowing people to gradually rid it from their own community and eventually removing it from the country altogether.\n\nThis is a stark contrast from Noname’s strategy on education, as she speaks loudly on the issues on her various social media accounts.']]), ('But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?\n Well, maybe ‘cause deep down I know I ain’t doin’ enough', [[""Snow on tha Bluff is a January 2011 movie about Curtis Snow, an Atlanta robber and crack dealer who, in the film, stole a camera from college kids during a drug deal and made an autobiographical documentary.\n\nThe film was so convincing that the Atlanta PD tried to link its footage to a string of home invasion robberies from around the time of the film’s release, but the film was ultimately unconnected from the other events. However, Snow was later arrested in May 2016 on charges for aggravated assault.\n\nCole plays off the film’s realistic filming style, which seemed like documentary footage to many on the surface but ended up being fictional after deeper investigation. He feels that he may be all talk when it comes to the Black Lives Matter movement, as if he has come up short in his support for the movement.\n\nNotably, Cole comes full circle in the last line of the verse. In the first line of the song, he says that he is perceived as “deep” by the public:\n\nNiggas be thinkin' I’m deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree\n\nWhile at first he acknowledges that he is deep on the surface, Cole ends the verse by questioning his inner motives, wondering if he really is interpreting the movement to the fullest extent that he can rather than just acting like he is doing so.""]]), ('Niggas be thinkin’ I’m deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree', [['J. Cole graduated from St. John’s University in Queens, New York in 2007, earning magna cum laude honors and accruing a 3.82 GPA over his tenure. He detailed his college lifestyle in his May 2007 track, “College Boy,” which was released right as he was graduating from school.\n\nCole is implying that, although he may have earned a college degree, that doesn’t indicate that he can’t continue to be educated by others who are more aware of things that he is not. This ties into the ensuing lyrics in which he broaches a discussion with Noname. He is also saying that his fans falsely place him on a higher pedestal simply because of his education, but he’s warning them not to.\n\nInterestingly enough, Cole majored in communications with a minor in business, two paths of study that may have helped with both the lyrical side of his career, as he communicates through music, and the managerial side, as he is the owner and co-founder of Dreamville Records.']]), ('And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don’t see\n Just ’cause you woke and I’m not, that shit ain’t no reason to talk like you better than me\n How you gon’ lead, when you attackin’ the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin’?\n Instead of conveyin’ you holier, come help us get up to speed', [['Continuing the allusions to Noname, Cole comments on how she should seek to educate as an aspect of her leadership rather than simply putting down the people who do not yet understand the implications of race relations in the country. He calls her out for attacking him and other “conscious” rappers for not tweeting about the racial climate of America.\n\nMoreso, Cole is emphasizing that to truly educate the people, it will require more effort than simply posting on social media or “retweeting.” He knows that actually having in-person discussions can have more permanent effects on uneducated people.\n\nOn May 29, Noname tweeted:\n\n\nPoor black folks all over the country are putting their bodies on the line in protest for our collective safety, and y’all favorite top-selling rappers not even willing to put a tweet up. Niggas’ whole discographies be about black plight, and they nowhere to be found.\n\n(Edited for clarity.)\n\n\nGiven the contents of their discographies, many fans perceived Noname’s tweets as allusions to J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar being silent about the current events.\n\nOn May 30, Cole was pictured humbly protesting in the streets of his hometown, Fayetteville, NC, a subtle rebuttal to Noname’s shaming.\n\n\n\nDespite Cole’s words, Noname has taken an active role in educating people outside of social media. In July 2019, she started Noname’s Book Club, which strives to educate and empower people of color. The club is also active in bringing these books to correctional facilities. Its website reads:\n\nNoname’s Book Club is an online/IRL community dedicated to uplifting POC voices. We do this by highlighting two books each month written by authors of color. In addition to our social media presence, we feel it is highly important to have free in-person meetups to discuss the monthly picks in a safe and supportive environment. Currently, we have six local chapters with plans for continuous growth.\n\nUltimately, Cole recognizes that he was partially wrong in his commentary on her work, as he wrote this on Twitter the morning after releasing the song:\nhttps://twitter.com/JColeNC/status/1273229943246409728']]), ('My IQ is average, there’s a young lady out there, she way smarter than me\n I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read\n She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police\n She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve\n She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin’ she talkin’ ’bout me', [['J. Cole may be subtly speaking about Noname, a multi-genre artist from Chicago, Illinois who has been extremely vocal alongside the rise in the Black Lives Matter movement during the protests for the death of George Floyd.\n\nDuring the protests, she has called out the system of capitalism, the American policing system, and the history of America that white people took over, but has also called out many celebrities, both black and white, for not taking part in the movement and using their platform and resources to progress the cause.\n\nWith Noname’s especially harsh critique of wealthy black men playing into white supremacy by not directly calling out the different forms of white supremacy, Cole thought she may have been talking about himself, especially after she made multiple tweets about conscious rappers not speaking up on the issue on May 29, 2020:\n\n\nPoor black folks all over the country are putting their bodies on the line in protest for our collective safety and y’all favorite top selling rappers not even willing to put a tweet up.\n\nniggas whole discographies be about black plight and they no where to be found\n\n\nHowever, Cole has been very involved with the movement, as he marched in his hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina days after Floyd’s death on top of dropping this song to support the movement.\n\nThe morning after the song’s release, Cole made a string of tweets seemingly confirming that Noname was the target of these critiques, an excerpt of which directly implicates her vocalness in the song’s content:\n\nFollow @noname. I love and honor her as a leader in these times. She has done and is doing the reading and the listening and the learning on the path that she truly believes is the correct one for our people.

On the track, both artists talk about their personal struggles with girls and drugs, whilst also touching on their fast paced lives.

The track leaked on YouTube on April 18, 2020, and was later confirmed in the comment section of LAROI’s Instagram post to be  released alongside a music video. However, the leaked version featured a different first verse from LAROI, and he explained the reason for the change in a livestream on Caffeine, on June 12th, 2020, saying:

I wanted to keep it the way that we made it, ‘cause […] I put the [leaked] verse on after Juice had passed. And it just felt bad to not do it like the original was and put it out like that. So, that’s why you guys didn’t get the “leaked version.“ I know that maybe you guys think the leaked one was better. But this is the original one.","[('I don’t know no better (I don’t)', [['This is an interpolation of Major Lazer’s 2017 hit “Know No Better,” featuring Travis Scott, Camila Cabello and Quavo.

So we went back and [Juice] said, “Sorry I missed your birthday dinner, but fuck it – for your birthday I’ll just give you a verse\' – like $200,000 worth. I Airdropped his engineer a few songs. I didn’t even really mean to airdrop [“Go“] because I had recorded it so long ago but he was like, ""This is the one, this is the one! Come on, load it up, let’s get it!”']]), ('Perky with the lean, it got me slow, slow, slow', [['“Perky” is a slang term for percocet, which is an opioid pain reliever used to treat moderate to severe pain. However when they are abused, they can result in an euphoric experience for the user. Taking percocet in conjunction with other drugs can “slow” ones breathing.\n\n“Lean” is a liquid mixture of codeine, promethazine cough syrup and soda. Drinking lean also results in an euphoric experience for the user but has side effects, these include tiredness, lack of energy and drowsiness. These effects, along with the percocet, explain why Juice is feeling “slow.”\n\nDrug use is a common theme in Juice WRLD’s music, specifically percocet and lean. For example, he also refers to both drugs in his 2018 single “Lean Wit Me”:\n\nLean with me, pop with me\n\nOn December 8, 2019, Juice WRLD sadly passed away after suffering a seizure from a drug overdose.

But I wanted to keep it the way that we made it, ‘cause like I said I put the new verse on after Juice had passed. And it just felt bad to not do it like the original was and put it out like that.

But if she really does what she say she can do, if she keeps all her promises and then she does all that other shit then it’s like, damn, I can’t let her go because I feel like there’s a whole bunch of girls who will say a lot of shit and not do a lot of shit.\n\nHe also sings a similar line within another 2019 track “Too Much (Demo),“ where he reiterates:\n\nBut I don’t wanna feel how I felt before\nI’m running back to you, I’m running back to you']]), ('Won’t let go, I’m the type to show you that you’re too special', [['This line is reminiscent of Juice’s March 2019 track “Won’t Let Go,“ a track in which he expresses his love for his significant other.

The lead single and album was first revealed in an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on February 6, 2019.","[('‘Cause there is so much wrong goin’ on outside', [['unless they’re some vampires or something outdoors, problems don’t tend to go away once you get ‘inside’. however, the character instead seems to be figuratively drawing a barrier between the scary, bad, worrying, etc things that are going wrong in most aspects of their life. when they are with the “you” character, it is easier and they can relax, they have found a home to go to, ie the inside.']]), ('This conversation ain’t coming easily', [['the conversation is not described, so it could potentially just be a dip or silence in a conversation between the two characters. however, the reason it’s not coming easily could be because the character is nervous to express something, such as their feelings as they’re going through a bad time, or possibly a confession; perhaps they are awkwardly telling the other character that they like them as more than a friend, or that they love them. this can be inferred as the character wants to be walked home by them, have them stay tonight, and is relying on them in a difficult time of their life.']]), ('Tryna stand up on my own two feet', [['this could possibly taken in a very literal way: since they’re walking home at night, it’s like this voice is kind of intoxicated. however, in a more figurative sense, this person is trying to be independent and stand up for themself, which is likely a reason they seem to be struggling and are going through a hard period']]), ('There’s somethin’ in the way you roll your eyes\n Takes me back to a better time\n When I saw everything is good\n But now you’re the only thing that’s good', [['This is a simple and mostly literal song, yet it can be read in a number of ways, which makes it so universal and appreciated.\nIn the first few lines, the singer is nostalgic over the “better time”, a theme which is continually repeated in the song. These ‘times’, it’s not clear what was occurring during them, but it’s clear that the singer is going through a significant struggle in life right now and is looking back on when life was simpler and better. The “you” described in the song has known her both in the good and bad times, and while she is struggling, she continues to be close to “you”. This is intended as universal, neither the “I” nor “you” person is given any gender, for example, and it’s not stated whether they are romantically or platonically involved. Most people can relate to experiencing difficulty in life and relying on a good friend or partner to fall back on.']])]","['pink never disappoint with her songs.. so catchy..gon be on repeat till I pass out….', 'this song means so much to me…\nthanks…Mrs.', ""You can defs hear Nate Ruess' influence…I’m here for it."", 'beautiful.', 'Pink is back with this super song !

Fue tanto dolor que ya no me mataba
Poco a poco ya no te necesitaba
Y yo sonreía mientra' lo enrolaba
Y tú (Uh-uh-uh)
Diciendo que fue falta de actitud

To' los fine' de semana está de party en party (Wuh)
Sigue matando las gana' con botella y mari
Te dejaron un estado ahí, ahí, ahí
Dice ""me sigue tirando y no caí ahí, ahí"" (¿Qué, qué?)
Incumpliste el contrato, yo puse lo que faltaba

Todo empezó con el bloqueo de WhatsApp
Por más que tú la llames tampoco va a contestar
Ahora ella anda solo de rumba y tú te derrumbas
Lloras tú porque sus lágrimas no valoraste
Hasta tu madre dice que no la cuidaste
Su corazón te odia por lo mal que la trataste
Y si te ve en la calle seguro te saca el de'o
La cogiste de pendeja, ahora tú eres su pendejo (Wuh)
Tú caíste muy bajo, en la fiesta borracho
Te merece' en tu vida todo' los cacho' (Toma)

No quiere saber de ti, quemando pa' la venta
El carajo, brother, calma, te pasó la cuenta (Pum-pum-pum)
Y ahora anda rollin' rompiendo la calle (Eah)
Se cansó, ya no quiere coro con nadie
Le cogió el gusto y ya no hay quién la pare
Y ahora está difícil de nuevo que la jale (Farru)
Ahora ella quiere carretera
Y ahora más que ahora está soltera
Bebe y fuma la noche entera
Y le da tremenda loquera
Cuando coge la borrachera
Le da con oír ""Safaera""
Y le entra la bellaquera
Pero no se la da a cualquiera

Le despreocupación del hombre por la relación hizo que la mujer se cansara de él y a raíz de esto ella se aventura a vivir su vida y los roles cambian. Ahora es el hombre quien quiere volver, pero ya es muy tarde y la mujer no tiene interés ninguno en recuperar la relación.

La intención de hacerle un remix fue dada a conocer por Sech, quien el 22 de junio de 2020 publicó un video en Instagram cantando “Relación” y preguntando lo siguiente:

Si algún día hiciera este REMIX Y TU FUERAS EL PRODUCTOR CON QUIEN SERÍA ? 👇👇

El colombiano Keityn comentó esta publicación, sugiriendo que uno de los artistas con los que usualmente trabaja hace parte de la remezcla. El 28 de junio el panameño volvió a pedirle a sus fanáticos que le recomienden un artista para el remix, pero esta vez confirmándolo.

Wonder why I ain't gettin' searched
Nigga, TIP been solid, speak against his name in the hood

Had straps out wildin', but moments in the past
Just made me who I am, that's why I don't run from it
Keep it one hunnid', anyone who don't like it, then fuck 'em
Get a little money then double, level
Came a way from sellin' weed in the envelope
To Puff Daddy standin' with me in chinchilla

Know these pussy niggas wishin' shit would fan out, it won't

Say I ain't the shit, that nigga must be dippin' acid
Fuck what all them other niggas doin', all I know is keep goin'
Start gettin' money, enjoyed it
Started sellin' crack for employment
Make it out of Georgia, that was a nigga only intent
Get them suckas out the way and get rich
Blockin' my path, boy, the .40 cal start barkin'
Like my nigga DMX in this bitch
I'm a vet at this shit, and all I ever been was authentic
Twenty years, I been handlin' my business
Get in my bag, stackin' my pennies

The song was first teased in a 28-second snippet posted by Tyler on May 13, 2019. It is one of the softer cuts on the album with the chorus featuring prominent use of a soul sample, with glittery synths and keys littered throughout the background.

Tyler seems to be alluding to his possible bisexuality, with the lyrical similes of his lover being like a gun and the title of the track being “A BOY IS A GUN*.” Throughout the song, Tyler compares being with his love interest with gun ownership in several ways.

The title “A BOY IS A GUN*” was inspired by the 1971 French western movie A Girl Is a Gun which Tyler confirmed at the IGOR Apple Music concert.

The song’s music video was released on September 16th, 2019.","[('Well, let’s see if you ’round a god around this time next year', [['In the previous song, NEW MAGIC WAND, it is insinuated that Tyler kills or at least attempts to kill his crush’s girlfriend.\n\nThis song chronologically happens before NEW MAGIC WAND\n\nor\n\nTyler is gonna finish the job and make sure she’s not around next year']]), ('When the time’s right, yeah\n When the time’s right, baby\n When the time’s right (A boy is a gun)\n (Turn me up a little bit)', [['He Doesn’t Want This Relationship To End Now, But It’s Quite Inevitable And Therefore, He Wants This Couple Of His To Return To Normal “When The Time Is Right”']]), ('That’s why these other niggas lame to us\n ’Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck', [['Pretty positive these lines are a reference to Kanye West’s “Bound 2” in the first line of that song he says “All them other niggas lame, and you know it now”.']]), ('That’s why these other niggas lame to us\n ’Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck', [['Pretty positive these lines are a reference to Kanye West’s “Bound 2” in the first line of that song he says “All them other niggas lame, and you know it now”.']]), ('No, don’t shoot me down (Yeah)\n No, don’t shoot me down (Okay)\n No, don’t shoot me down', [['Igor refers to both a literal interpretation of a gun, as well as a metaphorical one.

In the song, Tyler sings about a lover he depends on, who he knows he hasn’t treated the best, but needs. This is done over beautiful, cheery piano chords and heavy, distorted drums, mixing styles from his last two albums, Cherry Bomb and Flower Boy.

In an interview with Rick Rubin on his podcast Broken Record, Tyler explains that his inspiration for the title came from there being an actual earthquake when he was writing the song. Then he decided to change the “th” to an “f.”

During Tyler’s concert hosted by Apple Music with IGOR presentation, Tyler said the song is from 2017, and he wrote it for Justin Bieber, but “he didn’t take it.” It was also offered to Rihanna who also declined.","[('[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Charlie Wilson]', [['Tyler’s second verse sounds noticeably similar and is reminiscing/alluding to his 2011 track, She featuring Frank Ocean, where he raps:\n\nI just wanna talk, and conversate\n‘Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate\nAnd I finally got the courage to ask you on a date\nSo just say yes, let the future fall into place\n\nBoth of these verses are found later in the song and have similar flows, rhyme schemes, and topics.']]), ('And you don’t want my conversation (I don’t want no conversation)', [['Frank Ocean had a similar line on “Nights” from his album Blonde:\n\nShut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation\n\n“Nights” is about coping with relationship problems. Frank is irritated by his lover’s care and would just like to vibe in silence.\n\nOn “EARFQUAKE”, Tyler seems to be on the other side of the relationship – throughout the whole song he’s desperate to keep his lover by his side even though his partner doesn’t show much affection.\n\nTyler and Frank were both members of the LA-based hip-hop collective Odd Future. Although Frank can’t be heard on IGOR, he helped in creating “I THINK” – the third song on the album.']]), ('Don’t leave, it’s my fault\n Don’t leave, it’s my fault\n Don’t leave, it’s my fault (Girl)', [['Keeping with the track’s ongoing theme of earthquakes, Tyler creates a double entendre with the word “fault”.\n\nA fault is a thin zone of crushed rock separating blocks of the earth’s crust.

However, the person Tyler is in love with is still thinking about their previous relationship with a woman. In the song, Tyler goes to extreme length such as threatening to kill both his love interest and his love interest’s ex-girlfriend in order to get what he wants.

On September 12, 2020, Tyler determined that “NEW MAGIC WAND” is his best song ever in a tweeted bracket ranking of all his own favorite songs.  The song beat out OKAGA, CA for the number one spot.  Tyler had previously declared it his favorite song on IGOR through Instagram on May 30, 2019.

The song was first teased in a 47-second snippet posted on Tyler’s social media platforms on May 14, 2019. The song opens with grimy beat, and features a soft synth change during the bridge.

Tyler also referenced this track in a numerous tweets[1][2] before the album released.

In response to these claims, she told personal friend and former Grateful Dead manager, Richard Hundgen:\n\nI hear a rumor that somebody in San Francisco is spreading stories that I’m a dyke.

He’s seen similar situations to Tyler’s unfold, notably in 2016’s “Wolves” for example:\n\nYou tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage\nYou left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich\n\nIt’s worth noting that Tyler cites Kanye as a prominent influence for him in general.

The rhyme scheme suggests that he’d rhyme this line with “bread”, which would then be completed with “instead.”\n\nHowever, he abruptly inserts “a hug” to throw the listener off. This most likely implies that he would’ve asked the person “Do you need head?”\n\nWhen performing this song live, Tyler sometimes does say “head” instead of hug.']]), ('But at some point, you come to your senses', [['Seemingly this is him being freed from a toxic relationship, but it’s actually Tyler lying to himself, and not being able to let go of this person, he does this a couple of times on the album, even on the final 2 lines of the album;\n\n“A BOY IS A GUN”:\n\nI ain’t gon\' repeat myself, but stay the fuck away from me"").\n\nThe next track on the album (WHAT’S GOOD) ends with “I don’t know what’s harder, letting go or just being okay with it” it shows us that even though he seemingly “came to his senses”, he was just pretending and still can’t let go of this person.\n\nOn “GONE, GONE / THANK YOU” Tyler seemingly accepts the loss of this person and he never wants to fall in love again, but that is only because how hurt he is:\n\nAnd now I’m scarred for life\n\nOnce again on the next track I DON’T LOVE YOU ANYMORE Tyler says that he is no longer in love and is completely over it, yet he still chases this love (to an extent) on the last track ARE WE STILL FRIENDS? where he admits that he can’t let go, with even the final 2 lines of the album being:\n\nCan’t say goodbye\n\nTyler clearly still has deep feelings for this person, even though he pretended like he didn’t because he was left scarred.

Thematically, it introduces tension to the love dynamic previously constructed throughout the album.

During Tyler’s Apple Music Concert in L.A, he explained that he showed the album to Kendrick Lamar, where Kendrick praised him about the raw feeling of the album and his overall willingness to ‘sing his truth’. This conversation led him to write this song.","[('Spells', [['The word spells here references the next song on IGOR, NEW MAGIC WAND. In this song, Tyler is struggling to find a way to make his love interest love him, but in NEW MAGIC WAND he comes up with a plan to shoot and kill his love interest’s ex-girlfriend.\n\nThe word also shows that his attraction to his love interest is relatively one-sided, since he needs “spells” to appease his lover and keep them around.']]), ('Take your mask off', [['A theme which permeates throughout this album is the notion that Tyler’s partner is hiding himself from both Tyler and from the world. This could potentially take the form of him maintaining a relationship with an ex-girlfriend, which Tyler references repeatedly on this album, or it could be that this partner is using heterosexuality to mask his true self.\n\nThe phrase “take that mask off” was also used by a BROCKHAMPTON frontman, Kevin Abstract (who includes Tyler as his biggest music influence) as an allusion to men who live their lives in the closet.']]), ('Wade in your water (Wade in your water)', [['This phrase is in reference to “Wade in the Water,” written by John Wesley Work II and Frederick J. Work. The song’s lyrics were used in the Underground Railroad during the age of slavery as instructions to escape dogs and slave owners.\n\nIn this phrase and to the end of the verse, Tyler sings about wading in “your water” to the person he is singing to. The theme of escape in the song is a tying motif, as he doesn’t want to be saved by anyone from drowning in the person’s love.']]), ('I need her out the picture (Wade in your water)', [[""The line resembles one that appears on the next song, “NEW MAGIC WAND”.\n\nI need to get her out the picture\nShe’s really fuckin' up my frame\n\nThe woman Tyler is referring to is his partner’s ex-girlfriend. Tyler’s partner is hiding himself from the world. One of the ways he does this is by maintaining a relationship with an ex-girlfriend, which Tyler references on the album – most notably on “NEW MAGIC WAND”.\n\n“Wade in the Water” is a Negro spiritual whose lyrics were first published in the 1901 edition of New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers. The lyrics were supposedly used by Harriet Tubman to instruct fugitive slaves to trudge through the water so the dogs chasing them will lose their scent.""]]), ('And now they working their all, another track out the DAW', [['“DAW” is short for Digital Audio Workstation. It’s a computerized system for sound recording, music production, mixing and mastering\n\nIt can be a single software program on a laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit, all the way to a complex configuration of numerous components controlled by a central computer.\n\nTyler, a prominent producer within his music, has previously used DAWs lyrically too, most notably in his verse on the Odd Future posse cut “Oldie” where he plays on 3 different DAW programs:\n\nI never had a Reason, nigga, I was just Ableton\nNot a fucking Logic contradicting dick head']]), ('Livin’ in pretend\n Keep it a buck fifty, fuck\n Are you livin’ in pretend?\n Are you–', [[""These lines are most likely in reference to Tyler’s partner, who the whole album is about. Tyler claims this person is wearing a “mask” to hide his true self from the world – hence “livin' in pretend”. What he’s hiding from the world is somewhat ambiguous but it seems likely that Tyler’s partner is a closeted gay or bisexual man. This is hinted at with him trying to maintain a relationship with his ex-girlfriend. He perhaps does this to mask his sexuality. No matter what it is that he’s hiding, it is slowly ruining the relationship between Tyler and him.\n\nTyler tweeted about this line hours before the album dropped, writing:\n\nkeep it a buck50 fuck areeee u living in pretend?……… drums\n\nThis was also mentioned on “November” from Tyler’s fourth studio album Flower Boy.\n\nWhat if I got comfortable?\nI gotta keep it buck fifty what""]]), ('I drift to the deep end\n Don’t save, don’t save, don’t save\n It’s a low tide (I’ll be fine)\n I found peace in drownin’', [[""Perhaps Tyler drew inspiration from frequent collaborator Frank Ocean, for whom this imagery is nothing new. In his track “Swim Good” off 2011’s nostalgia, ULTRA., he sings of driving his car into the ocean, which may be a reference to either suicide or purification. The song’s bridge reads:\n\nI’m goin' off (Throw me a line)\nDon’t try saving (Broke my heart)\nNo flares (Broke my heart)\nNo vest (Drove my love)\nAnd no fear\nWaves are washin' me out\n\nTyler uses the drowning motif to refer to the inescapable, overwhelming nature of falling in love.

It was first teased in a 48-second snippet posted on Tyler’s social media platforms on May 3, 2019, showing him dancing frantically to the song.

The track makes heavy use of drums and distorted synths, one of the more aggressive cuts from the album. It is also one of the only tracks that Tyler raps throughout.

On the Jon Z and Tyga assisted track, the rappers describe their wild lifestyles and discuss various topics including their relationships, alcohol, and weapons.

“Loco” is a Spanish term that translates to crazy, which fits the song’s overall theme of going out of control. YG chooses not to spell “loco” correctly, by replacing the ‘c’ with a ‘k’, because of his affiliation with the Blood gang and their rivalry with the Crip gang.

The song was originally released as a song on 9LOKK’s 2018 mixtape Lil Glokk That Stole Christmas, with 9LOKK being credited as the lead artist and Melly being listed as a feature. Later, on August 9, 2019, the song was re-released as a single, with Melly now being the lead artist and 9LOKK listed as the featured artist.

The song has since peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100, particularly due to a dance challenge that has gone viral on social media app TikTok.

The music video for the track, directed by DrewFilmedIt, was released on November 2, 2019. Melly reacted to the video from his jail cell over a FaceTime call with DJ Akademiks.

The track appeared on Melly’s debut studio album Melly Vs.

La canción trata sobre una persona que se dejó sobrellevar del ambiente de pasarla bien que se vive en la disco y se tomó un tiempo con su pareja para celebrar.

Este tema es un claro homenaje a la canción “It Wasn’t Me” de Shaggy, el cual es un clásico que ha sido utilizado como referencia en muchos temas, como “Va Segui” de Mark B, canción con la que “China” estuvo fuertemente comparada un mes antes de su estreno debido a que ambas tenían ritmos similares.

Anuel es el propietario de la canción y es quien le pone el nombre al tema, pero no significa nada. Hubo fuertes rumores de que el nombre fue puesto ya que en Puerto Rico, el verde es conocido como color china o color chinita. En cambio, la canción lleva por nombre China ya que la pista original (producida por DJ Snake) tenía rasgos asiáticos según Anuel y por eso este le puso así.

Siguiendo el tema, en primera instancia, el productor de esta canción iba a ser DJ Snake, quien por varios problemas de papeleo con Anuel no pudo ser incluido, entonces, se tuvo que cambiar al productor que hoy en día es Tainy, así mismo como se tuvo que cambiar el instrumental de esta. Todo esto en base a lo que dijo Anuel en una entrevista para MTV.

Cabe destacar que en la mayoría de temas que Anuel ha lanzado este 2019 ha estado envuelto con su novia y futura esposa Karol G. Según rumores, Anuel había dicho a principios del año que Karol G iba a ser la única fémina con la que iba a colaborar, a pesar de haberlo visto junto a Becky G en “Bubalu”.

Originalmente, el junte iba a ser el mismo sin J Balvin, este por su parte, fue añadido a último minuto. Por lo que se puede ver en el video, las tomas en donde Balvin aparece fueron grabadas en Cartagena, donde estuvo él sólo, ya que no se le ve en ninguna toma junto a los demás.

Tanto así que existe varias escenas en donde se usó una pantalla verde para aparentar que Balvin se encontraba en el set con los demás:","[('Yo tengo un problema de alcohol\n Yo no sé por qué soy así (Así, así)\n Pa’ mí que el doctor estaba bebiendo\n El día que yo nací (Mami, mami)', [[""Desde pequeñito escondío' de mi mamá, tú sabe', a los die' o doce, cuando uno es bien presentao', y estás por la casa, que tu pai dejó en la nevera una botella o lo que sea, y tú, bien presentao', te mete' a robarla y te robas la botellita.\n\n – Anuel AA para Genius Verified.""]]), ('Dios mío, perdóname\n No sé por qué yo le fallé (Fallé; uah)', [[""Eso es cuando ya te fuiste a fuego, y tu mujer te está llamando, y tú sabe' que ella sabe, y tú estás: “Diablo, ¿qué yo hice?

Y yo estoy como “tengo que hacer algo más duro”. Y como Yankee salía, yo hace poco había hablado con Yankee, yo le estaba hablando de la canción, que el coro me gustaba y me dijo: “Cuando tú quieras, grábala y la rehaces”.

The song gained popularity in March 2020, after it went viral on TikTok.

The song was written during a trip to Los Angeles, following a break-up that inspired BENEE to write “Supalonely” and “Blu.”. She explained the song’s sound to i-D in February 2020:

Sometimes when you’re sad you’re just like, ugh, get over it! I think when I listen to music like “Supalonely” where it’s making fun of the feeling of being sad, in a way it kind of makes me feel good in a very weird way. When I hear “Supalonely” now and when I perform it I feel happy.

During Elton John’s Rocket Hour radio show on Apple Music in March 2020, he expressed his love for the song, inviting BENEE to join him on-air. In an Instagram post Elton said:

The dessert-themed video also finds Selena dressed in a sailor suit as an Ice-Cream truck’s employee, with the K-Pop stars in stylish and colorful outfits, showcasing their choreographed moves.

The pop anthem recalls how love is one of the strongest forces for someone to have.

Halsey hinted the collaboration back in November of 2018 by saying the following:

I think we both have this conceptual thing that we really like to do so it can be cool to find some kind of like bridge, like that you know it’s really great for their mo and my ma that it kind of like signify the whole thing together.

Its English title is reminiscent of their 2014 hit “상남 (Boy in Luv)” similar to how the intro song for Map of the Soul: Persona, “Persona,” is reminiscent of their 2014 intro song  “Intro: Skool Luv Affair.” Both are throwbacks to BTS’s Skool Luv Affair era, and both indicate growth from that time.

The translation of its Korean title, “A Poem for Small Things,” hints toward the emotional message of the album.","[('때론 도망치게 해달라며 기도했어', [['Sometimes I prayed, let me run away\n\nRM tells the listener that, at times, he felt a desire to escape, this escape probably being from his life as an idol.\n\nThis is likely due to the various pressures created by constantly being in the spotlight, as the members of BTS would be. The members are perpetually subject to hate, criticism and unnecessary remarks, and must constantly meet the expectations enforced on them by the public in order to fulfil an “idol” image.']]), ('높아버린 sky, 커져버린 hall', [['Elevated sky, expanded halls\n\nThe “elevated sky, expanded halls” that RM speaks of refers to the high ceiling and wide space provided by a concert arena.\n\n\n\nIt is possible the sense of importance afforded by the volume of such venues contributed to RM being “a little stuck up” as he admits in the previous lines.']]), ('You got me high so fast', [['Colloquially, the word “high” is often used to describe a feeling of euphoria, and is said to be “often caused by a feeling of success”.\n\nBTS may be continuing to address ARMYs, telling them that it is thanks to them that BTS are high on the success they have achieved.']]), ('난 내 눈에 널 맞추고 싶어', [['I want you tuned in to my eyes/I want to be on eye level with you\n\nThis may imply that though their accrual of wealth and fame may indicate otherwise, BTS don’t wish to be above ARMYs, namely wanting to be on the same level as their fans.']]), ('이제 여긴 너무 높아', [[""Now it’s so high up here\n\nIn the years closely preceding the release of “Boy With Luv”, BTS' fame has reached new heights—to the point that their rise to success has been described by numerous news source as “world domination”.""]]), ('다 말하지 너무 작던 내가 영웅이 된 거라고 (Oh no)', [['Everyone says that I used to be so little and now I became a hero (Oh no)\n\nj-hope challenges the concept that by having helped so many people through their music, the messages they convey through said music and even their use of social media, BTS are heroes.\n\nThemes of heroism and all it entails are prevalent in the lyrics of several BTS songs, particularly in the form of self-comparison with Anpanman, a Japanese cartoon character who has no superpowers but is made of red bean bread, and chooses to offer pieces of himself to those in need:\n\nI don’t have biceps or pecs\nI don’t have a super car like Batman\nThe ideal hero is my fantasy\nBut all I can give you is Anpan\nI’ve dreamed of becoming a hero like Superman\nI ran with all my strength, jumping high up in the sky\nI’m not afraid of little things like bruising my knees\nA innocent fantasy of my childhood\n\n\n\n“Anpanman”, j-hope, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in “Boy With Luv”, j-hope counters this idea.

This track marks the first collaboration between the two artists. “Over Now” is Harris' first song under his name since 2019’s “Giant.”

On this upbeat track, Abel sings about letting go of a failed relationship for the better, stating that it was hard to get along in the relationship. He also says that both him and this girl use drugs to cope with the stress of the relationship. He expresses his feelings for the relationship throughout the track.

It was first previewed during Abel’s virtual TikTok concert on August 7, 2020. On August 20, he posted a picture of himself and Calvin Harris at Coachella 2014 on Instagram, teasing the line “Don‘t get too confused.” The track was officially announced by both artists on August 22, along with promotional posters.","[('Feedin’ the press, when we don’t speak\n But we’re both with somebody else\n So please stop callin’ me', [['It’s no surprise that paparazzi pries on celebrities private lives. Abel is tired of these press asking him private questions and rapidly being under the spotlight, with stories about his relationships and wants to move on once and for all.\n\nIn 2015, he’s spotted dating former supermodel, Bella Hadid  after they were seen flirting each other at Coachella, and since breaking up in November 2016. Then in January 2017, he started dating American singer-songwriter Selena Gomez, whom they eventually split up at October 2017. It was until April 2018, he reconciled with Bella Hadid after he was seen leaving Hadid’s apartment and kissing, but broke up again in August 2019.\n\n\n\nDuring the times, The Weeknd has been followed non-stop by media just to get a glimpse of his love life with other stars. In a Billboard interview, he opens up how it feels about “Dealing with paparazzi all the time.”\n\n\nI go out, and they’re there sometimes, but I don’t tell the whole world I’m going out…They literally followed me from Beverly Hills all the way down to Hollywood. I respect the paparazzi, it’s their job, I got no beef with them.\n\nI don’t need pictures of me being generated all the time.']]), ('But you always need that attention', [['Abel’s lover’s need for attention in a relationship is a theme he’s already touched on in his discography. In his 2016 album, Starboy, the chorus of the thirteenth track, “Attention” centres on the fact:\n\nYou’re only looking for attention\nYou only notice it cause I’m never around\nYou’re only looking for attention, oh, oh\nYou’re only looking for attention\nThe only problem is you’ll never get enough\nYou’re only looking for attention, oh, oh']]), ('So, I take this just to forget you\n I don’t regret those memories', [[""Abel alludes to taking drugs to numb his pain and forget his former lover. He makes a similar remark on “Faith”, singing:\n\nI’ve been sober for a year, now it’s time for me\nTo go back to my old ways, don’t you cry for me\n\nAdditionally, Abel talks about returning to drugs after his break up with Selena Gomez on his 2018 track “Privilege”:\n\nBut I'ma drink the pain away, I’ll be back to my old ways\nAnd I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh""]]), ('I don’t really care if your tears fall down your face', [['This shows a big contrast to the earlier 2020 Weeknd song “Save Your Tears” off his fourth studio album After Hours. As the song’s title already explains, Abel wanted his lover to certainly not be sad or cry, which could have happened while thinking about their complicated relationship.\n\nSave your tears for another day\n\nHowever, he managed to let go of their relationship, hence he doesn’t care anymore.']]), ('I need you to know that\n We ain’t ever gonna go back\n This time, it got so bad\n It’s best for me, it’s best for you\n I need you to know that\n Tried to love you, but I forced that\n All signs, we ignored that\n And it’s not the same', [['Abel is seemingly hinting that he is over his break-up with Bella Hadid. This connects with the narrative of his fourth studio album, After Hours, which was released in March 2020. Throughout the album, Abel apologizes to his significant other, like on “Scared To Live,” and he accepts the end of a relationship on “Until I Bleed Out”:\n\nI wanna cut you outta my dreams\n\nAbel also sang and wrote an apology letter to his significant other with “Final Lullaby,” the last track off of the deluxe version, which finds him making peace with a broken relationship:\n\nAnd I can’t make you stay\nIn this broken place\nAnd I hope you find peace\nClose your eyes as I put us to sleep\n\nIt’s also worth noting that there is a difference in the overall tone of this song in comparison to the songs on After Hours; this track is less somber due to its funk-pop backdrop, which is reminiscent of the sounds Abel applied on his sophomore studio album, Beauty Behind the Madness, which was released exactly five years before this track.']])]","['2020 is just a long ass Weeknd 🩸', 'THIS IS SO DAMN FIRE!!! 🔥', 'how the fuck this gem didn’t make it to the album?', 'Weeknd x Calvin Harris and it’s all “Over Now”', 'Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 2', 'put this shit in the charts', 'If he previewed this, he’s probably gonna drop it', 'year of summer hits 🔥😍', 'Drop that shit Abel 🔥🔥🔥🔥', 'WHAT A TRACK🔥🔥🔥', 'and now I’m in my feelings again… pain', 'Yoooo.

The track is built around a bass-heavy trap beat and a looping sample of DJ Frank Ski’s “Whores In This House.” The song’s raunchy lyrics detail Cardi and Megan’s sexual fantasies.

According to Cardi, the song is so explicit Atlantic Records was worried about its release, and even asked Cardi to put Megan on a different song:

When [the label] heard the song they were like, “We really like it, but that song is so explicit.” … They were like, “Can you please get another record and you could put Megan on it?” And I was like, “No.”

Like other sex-positive songs by female artists, these lyrics sparked online controversy. However, they were also widely praised for their message of female empowerment and sexual liberation.

The pair first revealed the song on August 3, 2020, with an announcement that the music video would premiere alongside its release three days later.","[('Your honor, I’m a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes', [[""In an interview with GQ, a fan asked on Twitter what the line meant. In response, Megan said:\n\nI’m just letting y'all know, I will go say it in front of the judge. Like, this is how true it is. I’ll put my right hand on it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF_DUdrXUoQ""]]), ('Put him on his knees, give him somethin’ to believe in', [['Megan likens dropping to give her oral sex to devout religious people preparing for prayer, implying that it’s a form of worship towards her. This is actually a quite clever quick use of reference to faith to make a deliberately vulgar remark.']]), ('With a hook in it, hope it lean over', [['Cardi uses the hook euphemism to say that she likes her partner’s snake to have a curve in it. While there are many types of penis shapes, one with an up curve can help hit the G-Spot. This line could also be a reference to Meg’s song, “Captain Hook” where she says:\n\nI like a dick with a little bit of curve\nHit this pussy with an uppercut\nCall that nigga Captain Hook']]), ('Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker', [['Cardi refers to “Hennessy,” a French wining company and one of the oldest manufacturers of cognac.\n\nThe brand has had a long history with African American culture, from advertisements in black neighborhoods, the company was also a leader in hiring black people in ranks of leadership.\n\n\n\nIn popular culture, “Hennessy” is mentioned in hundreds of hip-hop and pop songs, to name a few, “KC Tea” (2010) by Tech N9ne, 2Pac’s “Hennessey” (2004), “Hennesey n Buddah” (2000) by Snoop Dogg and many more, from other rappers such as Notorious B.I.G., Kanye West, and Rick Ross.']]), ('I don’t cook, I don’t clean\n But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)', [['Cardi B directly dismantles the long-standing gender stereotype of women surrounding cleaning and cooking within a household. Speaking to the overall theme of female empowerment, Cardi B describes her wealth and success while creating no space for the stereotypical, submissive figure. The line also claims the general sentiment that women who possess prowess in the bedroom do not have to cook or clean to attract a good husband.\n\n\n\nThe “ring” refers to her marriage to rapper Offset. She is rather overtly implying that the reason Offset proposed is because she’s good in bed.']]), ('In the food chain, I’m the one that eat ya', [['Megan connects dominance with the act of giving oral sex, subverting the stereotype that it’s a submissive activity. This is done through a reference to her position on the food chain where carnivores are considered to be at the top.\n\n\n\nDuring the music video, this line is highlighted by Megan’s tiger striped outfit and a cameo from some white Bengal tigers.']]), ('Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n Yeah, you fuckin’ with some wet-ass pussy\n Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy\n Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy', [[""Talking about her WAP is pretty commonplace for Cardi, so her making a song about it almost seemed inevitable. For example, on her breakout hit, “Bodak Yellow”, Cardi raps:\n\nMy pussy feel like a lake\n\nOn “Press”:\n\nPussy still wet like Florida\n\nOn “Clout”:\n\nPussy still wet like a big bitch\n\nOn “Kama Sutra”:\n\nPussy so deep, you gon' drown or gon' swim (Splash, splash!)\n\nAnd so on and so forth.""]]), ('Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes', [['Interestingly enough, Cardi expressed anything but enthusiasm towards the idea of a man spitting in her mouth during sex on Twitter in September 2019.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/iamcardib/status/1171875970074251266']]), ('I let him taste it, now he diabetic', [['Diabetes is a lifelong health condition that comes about when a person’s blood sugar is too high – which is usually a result of a sugar-rich diet.\n\n“Cookie” and “cake” are slang terms often used to refer to one’s vagina or ass. Eating a lot of “sweets” like cakes and cookies might elevate your blood sugar, resulting in diabetes.\n\nShe’s  alluded to the apparent “sweetness” of her private parts before on “Money Bag”, when she referenced Plies‘ “Sweet Pussy Saturday” Instagram videos:\n\nThis is sweet pussy Saturday, that’s just what Plies say']]), ('Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)', [['“Pullout game” describes one’s ability to perform coitus interruptus, an ineffective birth control method that involves pulling one’s penis out of a vagina before ejaculation to avoid insemination. The term became especially popular starting in June 2014.\n\nCardi claims that the feeling of having sex with her is so good that it would hinder any man’s attempts at pulling out.']])]","['I hope Cardi and Nicki become friends again cause I know they would have made a fire ass track', 'Being honest… this is so bad', 'People out here saying this song is trash cause they are rapping about their pussy while they support make rappers that rap about other pussys… FUNNY, yall just sexists asf', 'Megan verse was 🔥 that’s what happen when you write your sh*it', 'reading the lyrics like', 'wait what!?!? 2020 is gonna be the year most female artists land #1 on BB Hot 100.', 'dudes talking about “it’s just a 3 minutes song about getting fucked” as if hundreds of rappers they worship haven’t made songs about fucking', 'GOBBLE ME SWALLOW ME DRIP DOWN THE SIDE OF ME', 'What the actual fuck is this garbage', 'I lost my virginity with this song…', 'DIDN’T EXPECT TO SEE KYLIE AND ALL THESE LADIES', 'Cardi: Dont cook dont clean\nNicki: Yes I do the cooking yes I do the cleaning\n\nCardi: Cookie A1 just like his credit\nNicki: He know this thing A1 like a felony', 'https://twitter.com/FeelingFisky/status/1291846730573463552?s=20', 'Alright boys, I think we have to get out', 'damn that’s some explicit shit', 'bruh this song highkey slap. and the video is straight 🔥', 'need some holy water', 'So, men can rap all they want about fcking women and their dcks, but when women do they same is trash????

On the song, Drake promises his significant other a luxurious lifestyle, including vacations to Greece and expensive clothing. He then switches up the mood at the end of the song, where he discusses relationship problems that stem from his wealth and status.

In the song, the artists talk about dancing and the possibility of how love could go much farther through dancing and teasing. Taki Taki has no official meaning, and it is believed that is used in the song just for better sound.

The rumors of this joint song first surfaced on 25 August 2018 when DJ Snake posted a photo on social media showing director stools for the four artists (plus Cardi’s daughter), teasing the collaboration between them.

The song was confirmed to be about 6 minutes prior to its release. But in fact the song only lasts for 3:32 after the release. Whether the song has ever been 6 minutes long before may never be truly resolved.","[('Ouija board', [['The ouija, also known as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9,']]), ('This punani', [['The female genitalia.']]), ('He said he wanna to touch it, and tease it, and squeeze it\n Well, my piggy bank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it', [['Cardi takes a note out of her hustling past—performing sexual acts on men in exchange for money and materialistic items.

En esta nueva versión, la canción ha sido adaptada al ritmo urbano para hablar de como un hombre se ve atraído hacia una mujer en la discoteca, una temática muy común en los temas actuales de reggaetón; sin embargo, se conservó un verso de la canción original, para que no se pierda la esencia que caracterizaba a “Informer”.","[('[Verso 3: Snow & Daddy Yankee]', [[""Este verso fue el mismo que Snow utilizó en su canción “Informer”, a la que “Con Calma” le hace un remix y homenaje.\n\nEl único cambio hecho en este verso es en la última línea, cambiando la palabra “daddy” por “Daddy Yankee”, dejando al artista como el nuevo protagonista del verso.

You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

This is mainly due to users on the popular video-sharing platform, TikTok, uploading videos of themselves dancing to it. Her August 2018 track “MOOO!” and March 2019’s “Juicy” had also achieved similar success on the platform.

On the upbeat R&B dance-inspired track, Doja sings about wanting her friend to stop “beating ‘round the bush” and confess their love to her. Because of a slight mix-up in the chorus of the song during its transcription on Genius, a small frenzy started on Twitter, with many fans thinking that Doja was singing “I get you hot and moaning.” This was later then cleared up by Doja after she tweeted the official lyrics on December 27, 2019, more than 7 weeks after its release.","[('And we can dance all day around it\n If you frontin’, I’ll be bouncing', [[""A few definitions for those that don’t understand the language here.\n\n“Dancing around it” is a common English expression that means to avoid discussing something or avoid dealing with it directly.\n\n“Frontin'” refers to putting up a façade, to be faking it.\n\nTo be “bouncin'” / to “bounce” in this situation means to leave the room/area.\n\nThe entire first verse is Doja admitting she’s into this guy to herself, whilst knowing he’s into her too.

On August 29, 2019, Future teased a snippet of this track via his Instagram Story. On December 20, 2019, a second snippet surfaced online. A demo of the song, thought to be titled “I Know,” was leaked on January 4, 2020.

On January 31, 2020, an official version of the track was released on the OVO SoundCloud page. The official version featured two additional verses from Drake. The track appeared under the title “DESIRES LEAK 2020 SUPER FUTURE DRAKE,” indicating that Drake and Future were aware of the demo’s leak.

The song was eventually placed on Drake’s fifth mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes.","[('I’m in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah', [['This is a nod to the Ferrari 812, although there are two versions—the Superfast and its convertible version, the GTS.

In the 1960s, local land developers began to develop neighborhoods and suburban communities throughout Katy, due to the overgrowing population in Houston. Today, communities in Katy, south of I-10, are predominantly upper-middle class, in which mansions and golf courses are not uncommon. The I-10 corridor, a major highway that runs through the city of Houston, passes through Katy, which makes it convenient for residents to access Houston’s Downtown district.\n\n\n\nDrake appears to believe Katy would have been a better location for his girl to live, since it’s further away from the trouble, temptations, or influences that seem to exist for his girl in Houston. Drake even goes as far as to consider the city of Dallas, the third most populated city in the state of Texas, and four hours away of Houston, as another possible home for his girl. Since Dallas has several areas of luxurious housing as well, it could be a comfortable place for his girl to live, and more importantly, away from Houston, as far as the rapper is concerned.\n\n\n\nDowntown Dallas']]), ('And you just wanna hear some chune, some music\n I think, you know, you found the right spot', [['“Chune” is the Jamaican Patois pronunciation of the word “tune,” which is used to refer to a song.

The song came about as Giveon was on tour with Snoh Aalegra and decided to make a freestyle for every city he visited, hence “Chicago Freestyle”. The title’s usage may or may not be a reference to Drake’s AM/PM series as a result, which contains similar elements. This would mark Drizzy’s first addition to the mini grouping since June 2016’s “4PM in Calabasas,” as he continues to revisit his past and focuses on lyricism. It is likely that Drizzy recorded the single in the “Windy City,” as his AM/PM series typically were named based on location.

There are many people who are out to get Drake knocked off his perch at the top of the music industry, and potentially also want him dead.

Addressing his current love interest, he highlights plenty of former relationships despite spending limits on his AMEX or American Express credit card.\n\nFor most consumers, credit card companies impose limits on the amount that one can spend each month. As a product of his established wealth, Drake has since moved on to the infamous American Express Centurion “black card,” an invitation-only charge card with no spending limits.\n\nMoving to the present, Drake finds perspective in examining past financial challenges but does not seek to detail misdeeds from lost love.']]), ('But I do know one thing though\n Women, they come they go\n Saturday through Sunday, Monday\n Monday through Sunday, yo\n Maybe I’ll love you one day\n Maybe we’ll someday grow\n ’Til then, I’ll sit my drunk ass on that runway\n On this one way', [['Drake pays tribute to Eminem by interpolating his May 2002 song “Superman” but with slightly changed lyrics:\n\nBut I do know one thing though\nBitches, they come, they go\nSaturday through Sunday, Monday\nMonday through Sunday, yo\nMaybe I’ll love you one day\nMaybe we’ll someday grow\n‘Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin’ runway, ho\n\nIn Eminem’s song, he takes a very aggressive tone. “Superman” was written in the wake of Eminem’s divorce and his falling out with Mariah Carey, with whom he allegedly had a brief relationship. In the chorus, Eminem is speaking to his admirer, who is likely Mariah, and he reminds the woman that she is dispensable. If she acts out, there are plenty of women in line that are ready to take her place.\n\nIn contrast, Drake’s interpretation of the lyrics is melancholic. He has grown tired of quick relationships and is looking for something more serious, but his current lifestyle makes that impossible. In Drake’s version, the “runway” is an airport runway, where he has boarded a one-way flight to his next show.']]), ('Two-thirty, baby, won’t you meet me by The Bean?', [['In accordance with the track’s title, Giveon drops multiple iconic characteristics of the track’s titular city.\n\nFirstly, Cloud Gate, known by its popular name “The Chicago Bean,” is a public art sculpture designed by Indian-British sculptor Anish Kapoor that was first unveiled in 2004 in Millennium Park, Chicago. The sculpture has become an iconic piece of Chicago and is one of the most popular tourist locations in the city.\n\n\n\nSecondly, Chicago’s nickname is “The Windy City.” While this nickname is usually attributed to Chicago’s freezing cold temperatures due to the winds coming from Lake Michigan, the name is thought to have been  actually derived in the 1800s with politicians in the city blowing “hot air,” which is a saying for spewing lots of words without any actual substance.']])]","['Me when I saw Drake randomly dropped this\n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/l2RnB2zd7hxtNimxa/giphy.mp4', 'This kid Giveon sounds like Sampha', ""That Eminem chorus..  god damn' goosebumps,"", 'The second he said “But I do know one thing, no\nWomen they come and go”, I immediately lost my shit. 🔥', 'Drake always coming in clutch right when I’m going thru sum shit he drops music to make me feel better 🙏', 'I need this on Spotify. sheesh that chorus', 'DRAKE IS BACK!

Carti even named a song after him in 2015.

The track was revealed on June 7, 2019, by Ian on Twitter in a screenshot reading “Drake x Carti – ‘Pain 1993’ Noel Ref 1,“ with ""Noel” indicating that it was engineered by OVO Noel and “Ref 1” indicating that it is the first reference of the track.

Snippets of Drake’s vocals in the reference were leaked in January 2020. Drake previewed his chorus and verse in full on April 7, 2020, on Instagram Live, asking his fans to tell Carti to release it.

On April 16, 2020, a promotional video recorded by Ian Connor and Chris Skylark and edited by Nick Dolan was previewed on the Born from Pain Twitter, also previewing the chorus and most of Drake’s verse in full quality.

On April 29, 2020, Ian Connor posted a text message from Drake reading “So proud / Pain 1993 came to life” on Twitter, implying that Carti recorded a verse for the song. The next day, the song surfaced on Shazam showing that it was given back to Drake and would be released on Dark Lane Demo Tapes.

Drake confirmed its appearance on the project two hours later on Instagram. Snippets of the full song surfaced a few hours before its release.","[('Niggas ain’t gotta respect\n Niggas just gotta accept\n I put that top left', [['“Top left” is Toronto slang for telling the truth.

Both Cardi B and Camila have Latino lineage. In a 2017 article, PopSugar.com broke down Camila’s Cuban background. She spoke Spanish as her primary language for years before learning English.

While Camila has an unreleased 2018 track co-written by Ed Sheeran, this song marks the first collaboration between any of the featured artists.","[('He want the lil’ mamacita, margarita (Margarita)', [['Mamacita is the Spanish word for “mommy”, reflecting the Latin theme of the track. It’s used in a sexual context, as opposed to a literal mother (mamá or mamita).\n\nAccording to cocktail historian David Wondrich, margaritas are related to a popular Mexican drink called the Daisy (margarita is Spanish for “daisy”), which is made with brandy instead of tequila. Daisy cocktails became popular during Prohibition as people drifted over the border (ooh, that sounds familiar!) for alcohol.']]), ('You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs\n And the diamonds I prefer, in my closet, his and hers, ayy', [['In contrast to Camila, who’s looking for a more casual encounter with the man, Cardi’s after a more substantial relationship, but only if he can fund her expensive tastes.\n\nThat seems to reflect aspects of Cardi’s personal life, as she was scratching a living as a stripper before her hip hop career kicked off. It’s an occupation she speaks candidly about – how it empowered her to fund her education and music career.\n\nBecause of this, Cardi hasn’t always been taken seriously when it comes to her interest in politics and history.']]), ('Jump in that water, be free\n Come south of the border with me\n Jump in that water, be free\n Come south of the border with me', [['“The border” in this case is the U.S.-Mexico border, which is nearly 2,000 miles long (1,954 miles to be precise) and stretches from California to Texas; whilst “that water” is the body of water which stretches along the border from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n\nAnd South of the border, you’ll find Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n\n\nCamila and Cardi are both Latina and come from Spanish-speaking, Caribbean backgrounds.

Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)

The track is about remaining true to yourself and not trying to become one of those so-called “beautiful people” obsessed with material things and stature.

It opens with pretty vocal harmonies: “We are, we are, we are” floats over a winsome melody and handclap-enhanced rhythms. Sheeran and Khalid each sing a verse about uncomfortable social situations, where a person can feel “surrounded but still alone.” “We don’t fit in well/We are just ourselves.""

Sheeran shared a short clip via Instagram on June 27, 2019, letting fans know that the video will drop at 3 a.m. ET Friday, three hours after the song’s midnight release.","[('Champagne and rolled-up notes\n Prenups and broken homes', [['These lyrics see Sheeran contrasting glamour and pleasure with darker, more emotional themes.\n\nSnorting drugs through the nose with “rolled-up banknotes” is an age-old tradition that has long been associated with casual drug use.\nThe most commonly nasally ingested substance is cocaine, which is also considered to be a “rich man’s drug” due to it’s expense and popularity among wealthy people.\n\nAnother symbol of status and opulence is drinking alcohol in the shape of Champagne; a sparkling wine named after the region of its production in France.\n\n  \n\n\nA prenuptial agreement or just “prenup” is a contract agreed by two people before they enter into a marriage or civil partnership. Its purpose is to set out what would happen to each party’s finances in the event of relationship breakdown or divorce.\n\n“Broken home” is a name given to mean a family in which the parents are separated or divorced.']])]","['This song is such a vibe.

Yeah, they miss the old me
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (Yeah)
Never took much to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende (Woo)
Tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane
Slim Sha— mind's in the gutter, but insane
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame (Screamin' out no regrets)
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret

All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
But it's happening again, huh?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the kill shot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
For sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt (Yeah)
Shoulda never made a response, shoulda just aimed for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (Yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle (Handle)

On the track, Em revisits his troubled past and difficult come-up, while also coming to the realization that “he wouldn’t change [anything]” if he could go back and do everything over again, while Don delivers the track’s emotional chorus, which serves as an introspective look into their own origins and the way they impact their loved ones.

Em also addresses some of his more recent and prevalent beefs over the past few years, calling out rappers such as Nick Cannon, Machine Gun Kelly and Tyler, The Creator. Don addresses his sadness in being alone, but still is trying very hard not to have any regrets.

The song’s production is handled by D.A. Doman, whose hard-hitting instrumental highlights Em’s transition to a more modern trap style. This marks Doman’s third production credit on Music to Be Murdered By, following “Those Kinda Nights” and “Godzilla.”","[('I been on the bench\n Forgive and forget is the only thing I’d ever live to regret\n Hell-bent on revenge, you left me for dead\n I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set\n My enemies ain’t put an end to me yet', [['The audience turned away from Eminem several times.\n\n\nWhen he released the infamous Encore album in 2004, which was received coldly by critics and fans alike. The quality of the lyrics has dropped significantly compared to the two previous classic albums: The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show. The reason for the deterioration of the lyrics was Marshall’s drug addiction. Later, in 2008, he will recover from it.\nWhen he released his second infamous album Revival in 2017. In particular, the Pitchfork edition noted the tastelessness of the choruses on the album, the lines, some of which are embarrassing, and also mentioned the fact that this album plays almost no role in Eminem’s legacy.\n\n\n\nBut Eminem was not and is not going to give up. After an unsuccessful return to the stage in 2009, along with Relapse, Marshall released his seventh album, Recovery, which was well received. And after the release of Revival, Eminem fired back with Kamikaze album, which sold 434,000 copies in the first week, and this is given the fact that there was no advertising campaign before the release of the album.\n\n\n\nEminem posted this picture on his Instagram\n\nNothing can stop him.\n\n\n\n\nAlso noteworthy that there is even to these days the theory Eminem has died from 2005 to 2007 in a car crash and was replaced by a clone. So the line about leaving him for dead may be taken literally. Eminem has mentioned that on an unreleased track Fly Away that was recorded for the Recovery album but it didn’t make to it.\n\nEminem “crawled out his grave” in 2007 after he overdosed when he was 2 hours from dying and doctors gave up on him saying that his liver and kidneys are shut down.

Instead, he remains private and doesn’t reveal as much detail as he used to about his personal issues. “Nosebleeds” refers to cheaper seats very high up in a stadium or theater, the opposite of the “front row”.

All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger

I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again

Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater

I got spite inside my DNA

Their verses are polar opposites, a thematic structure often employed by Joyner in his songs to show opposing perspectives of the same topic (see “Ross Capicchioni” and “I’m Not Racist”).

Here, Joyner comments on how he hasn’t received any awards, although he is steadily gaining recognition. For instance, the video for his song “I’m Not Racist” went viral in 2017.

Em’s verse, on the other hand, is about how he’s at the top in terms of awards and status but is being overlooked in the current rap scene. This is a recurring theme throughout this album as well as other 2018 releases, such as the remix of “Chloraseptic.”","[('Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose', [['This line refers to how in the beginning of Eminem’s career he was careless of what he said.

Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)

Five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (Yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned, been
Countless times I've been doubted
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em
My God, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end

I'm leaving Heaven

Angels won't find me
Where I am going

Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil
I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving Heaven (Fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know what? Maybe if I hadn't had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where I am going (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")

But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react

The rappers' intense approach is similar to that of Kamikaze, with Eminem name-dropping various modern-day artists, while also bragging of his own superiority by comparing himself to Avengers villain Thanos and radical political leaders.","[('We ain’t the same, you and I', [['In recent years, a common theme for Eminem has been to claim his superiority over mumble rappers – and this occasion wouldn’t be the first time he’s dedicated an entire song to prove his point, either: Not Alike.']]), ('And I hit them pads like a boxing gym', [['A double entendre on the word pad.\n\nfirst he says he hits the pads (writing pads) so hard when writing, means he writes some dope shit.\n\n\n\nAnd he writing on the pads is as hard as he hitting boxing pads in a boxing gym.']]), ('You can leave this earth, bitch, I’m in rake mode', [['A rake is a term used to describe an immoral pleasure-seeker, or in other words, someone who will do anything to get what they want. Of course a rake is also a gardening tool used to snag up leaves fallen from a tree. This gives Young M.A.’s line another meaning when she says, “You can leave this earth, bitch, I’m in rake mode.']]), ('I won’t topple, I’m giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I’m not gonna stop', [['Amongst his disses aimed at Machine Gun Kelly, Eminem includes a similar lyric to his 2010 song with Lil Wayne, “No Love”:\n\n‘Til I’m topplin’ from the top, I’m not gonna stop\n\nThe lyrics also warns other rappers of the dangers of wanting trouble with Em. As of this song’s release, the last rapper to callout Em was Nick Cannon, who Em brutally responded to on “You Gon\' Learn.”\n\nThis line could also be a reference to a similar line in “The Ringer” where he says:\n\nI’m ‘bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it""']]), ('I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I’ma leave carnage', [['This could be a callback to Eminem’s song “Venom” from the film of the same name.

It is covered by the transparent cornea, which refracts the light and protects the eye’s internal structure.\n\nhttps://www.aao.org/image.axd?id=f8bf1127-6e24-4493-a428-16137daff804&t=636179207925430000\n\nIn another sense, a pupil is a student.  Em feels that those who strive to learn from him and follow in his footsteps are falling short and becoming corny, in the sense of being banal, trite, or laughably amateurish.  Considering the previous lines addressing Machine Gun Kelly, it’s clear Em places him in this category.']]), ('And I made a mil’ without a major deal (I made that)', [['Although she is now a member of Forbes 30 under 30, Young M.A made her first recordings in a self-funded recording studio with local producers while working at Shake Shack and T.J.

The others mentioned are Notorious B.I.G, Grand Puba and Ice Cube.\n\nThere are also somewhat similar lines in Em’s “Rap God,” where he states:\n\nNow I lead a new school full of students\nMe?

On the song, Abel sings about his tumultuous relationship with girlfriend Bella Hadid, assuring her that he “can’t lose” her again. He also sings, in explicit detail, about his illustrious sex life with Bella and other lovers. The “fire” is the time period between their initial breakup and reconnection.

“Lost in the Fire” found additional interest when lyrics in Abel’s first verse were interpreted as shots at Drake.

The track was first teased by Gesaffelstein on January 7, 2019. Abel continued to tease the song on his social media over the next three days. The song ultimately debuted on the third episode of The Weeknd’s Beats 1 Radio show Memento Mori, which aired at midnight on January 11, 2019.","[('You said you might be into girls (Into girls)\n Said you’re going through a phase (Through a phase)', [['Bella Hadid is unsure of her own sexuality. In 2015, it was rumored that she was seen kissing model Stella Maxwell. Furthermore, in an August 2017 Star Magazine article, it was speculated that Bella and longtime friend and fellow model Kendall Jenner were dating, something that Kendall denied.\n\nCommentators took offence to the idea that being attracted to people of the same gender is “a phase”.']]), ('I’ll take it off, you’re the one I’ll roll the dice on (Dice on, dice on, dice on)', [['To “Roll the dice” means to gamble or bet. The Weeknd and Bella Hadid are back together and he’s willing to take the condom off while they have intercourse.\n\nOn his Memento Mori exclusive Apple Music Beats1 radio show, he mentioned he does indeed plan to have a child with Bella.']]), ('I used to have a girl a day (Girl a day)', [['This is likely a callback to Abel’s 2011 mixtape Thursday and its eponymous track. The concept centered around him spending time with a separate girl each day. On the chorus, he specifically focuses on telling the story of the girl he visits on Thursday:\n\nNot on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday\nSunday, but on Thursday, Thursday\nNot on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday\nSunday, but on Thursday, make sure\nYou are thirsty oh, on Thursday, baby']]), ('Well, baby, you can bring a friend (Bring a friend)\n She can ride on top your face (Top your face)\n While I fuck you straight (While I fuck you straight, yeah)', [['The Weeknd petitions his girlfriend, Bella Hadid, to have a threesome with one of her friends. There have been rumors that she is bisexual.\n\nAbel’s music is typically sexually charged, so it’s no surprise he’s been singing about threesomes dating back to some of his earliest work—like on his March 2011 song “The Party & The After Party,” where he sings:\n\nGirl, bring your friends, if you want we can share\n\nThe “fuck you straight” lyric was criticized by some media outlets for being about turning a bisexual or homosexual woman heterosexual. On the other hand, Abel could be singing about a specific threesome where his significant other is having oral sex with another woman while he has sex with her in the same manner that a straight couple would.']]), ('And we lost a lot of things in the fire\n So it took a year for me to find out (Find out, find out)', [['Abel and supermodel Bella Hadid started dating in May 2015 and broke up in November 2016.\n\nIn January 2017, Abel started dating singer Selena Gomez, but in October 2017, they also broke up, prompting Abel to release his 2018 EP My Dear Melancholy,, where Gesaffelstein has two features.\n\nAfter a year of separation, Abel and Bella rekindled their relationship, and it took a year of not being together for him to realize that he cannot lose her.\n\nhttps://goo.gl/images/FWKziM']]), ('And I just want a baby with the right one\n (I just want a baby with the right—)\n ’Cause I could never be the one to hide one\n (I could never be the one to hide—)', [[""The Weeknd takes a shot at Drake who was accused of hiding his son Adonis on Pusha-T’s scathing May 2018 diss track, “The Story of Adidon”:\n\nYou are hiding a child, let that boy come home\nDeadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh\n\nDrake responded on his June 2018 track, “Emotionless”:\n\nI wasn’t hidin' my kid from the world\nI was hidin' the world from my kid\n\nUnlike Drake, who has a child with former pornstar Sophie Brussaux following a one-night stand, The Weeknd wants to make sure he’s with the right woman before having a child.\n\nDespite collaborating early in their careers, Abel and Drake have had an on-and-off feud since 2011. With these shots, Abel may be reigniting their feud after Drake seemingly attempted to get with Abel’s then ex-girlfriend, Bella Hadid. The Weeknd and Bella broke up in November 2016, and Drake and Bella were seen leaving an L.A. nightclub together in June 2017. After that, rumors arose that they were in a secret relationship.\n\nOn June 2018’s “Finesse,” Drake mentions attending New York Fashion Week with two sisters, which is likely a reference to Bella and her sister Gigi, both of whom annually attend the event.\n\nShould I do New York? I can’t decide\nFashion week is more your thing than mine […]\nYou and your sister\nToo hot to handle\n\nBella quickly dispelled any rumors of a relationship with Drake after “Finesse” released:\nhttps://twitter.com/bellahadid/status/1012764155458281473""]])]","['Did the weeknd just dissed drake?

On the flute-heavy track, Travis describes the loyalty that his Cactus Jack Records gang shares, while Thug crudely describes his sexual activities.

The song’s title refers to Los Angeles, California, not to the age of the American Frontier, which lasted from the early 1600s to the early 1900s. While Travis was born in Houston and Thug was born in Atlanta, both have lived in Los Angeles during times throughout the last few years and currently reside there. The two rappers use brash lyricism, an exotic melody and a hypnotizing beat to portray themselves as modern outlaws.

On March 20, 2020, the song’s official music video was released. It features Travis and Thug alongside Travis' Cactus Jack members Don Toliver, Sheck Wes, Luxury Tax, and Chase B, and Thug’s YSL members Yung Kayo and Young Jordan. The video also features a cameo appearance from 21 Savage, a frequent collaborator of both Travis and Thug.","[('I eat molly and I take this bitch on a trip', [['Methyl\u200benedioxy\u200bmethamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy or molly, is a psychoactive drug primarily used for recreational purposes.

The duo created a summer dance anthem with upbeat piano chords combined with MNEK’s catchy vocals—the song received acclaim, especially in the UK, reaching the number one spot on The Official Big Top 40 just two weeks after release.

MNEK sings about the conflict of thoughts between his head and his heart—this is shown through the music video, which is split in two halves, illustrating the head and the heart respectively.

In an interview with HollywoodLife, Joel Corry shared:

On the Marshmello-produced beat, Juice contrasts much of music and focuses on the positive side of his love and relationships.

The track was first previewed via Juice’s Twitter on November 30, 2018. The video was captioned “Off my chest,” leading people to incorrectly speculate that was the title of the song. An early version of the track was leaked on August 18, 2019, and was eventually released on July 9, 2020, one day before Legends Never Die.

The official music video was released on July 10, 2020.

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God

It draws a parallel between relationships and the prescriptions, stemming from both religion and outsiders. Chance focuses on both maintaining faith and enjoying life. The song serves as the lead single from Justin’s sixth studio album, Justice (2021).

The official music video premiered alongside the song on September 18, 2020. It also stars actress Ryan Destiny to play Justin’s love interest, while Chance is also present, but only for his verse.","[('I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father’s proud (Yes)\n If you make it to the water, He’ll part the clouds (Uh)', [['The sacrament of baptism is a Christian rite that commonly involves either being sprinkling or submerging someone in water. Baptism is considered to be testimony of one’s submission to God, thus it is performed either at one’s birth or conversion to Christianity, allowing God, the Holy Father, to part the clouds for one’s eternal life in Heaven as he did for Jesus in Luke 3:21-22.']]), ('But when you come out of the water', [['“Coming out of the water” is a phrase used to signify baptism, a sacrament and a public demonstration of your Christian faith. By being plunged into the water, you are then being spiritually washed of sins, pain, and your burden, by Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross.']]), ('The first step pleases the Father\n Might be the hardest to take', [['The “first step” in becoming a Christian refers to believing wholly in the Father, God, and asking forgiveness for one’s sins. According to Acts 2:38,\nand the Apostle Peter:\n\nPeter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.""\n\nThis step can often be the hardest because it comes from a place of vulnerability between you and God.']]), ('Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)', [['Christians partake in Holy Communion, also known as the Eucharist, a sacrament in remembrance of the body and blood of Jesus, which were broken and poured at the cross. Consecrated bread and wine are consumed according to Christ’s wish to do this in memory of Him.\n\nThen he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.']]), ('I’m a believer, my heart is fleshy', [['Chance quotes Ezekiel 36:26:\n\nI will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.\n\nThis means that God removes an obstinate nonbeliever’s “heart of stone,” representing their unwillingness to accept Him, and gives them a living, beating heart, reflecting their rebirth in Christ.']]), ('I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin’ next week', [['Chance quit smoking marijuana (weed) sometime in 2016. However, in the livestream between him and Bieber ten minutes before the song’s release, he announced that he smoked weed and instantly passed out. Bieber then talked about his previous addiction to drugs and showed his understanding of how and why weed is harmful.']]), ('I don’t believe in nirvana', [['Nirvana is the pure and true intention of the Buddhist journey—it gives peace and calm feelings like heaven. It is a state of enlightenment, causing the problems to vanish. Even though this is a Buddhist definition, many people believe secularly in it and follow its steps. However, Bieber is a person who does not believe in it—Christianity, together with the other Abrahamic religions, are strictly monotheistic and now reject syncretism with any other religions, so it could be heterodox or even heretical for a Christian to believe in Buddhist ideas.']]), ('On God\n Runnin’ to the altar like a track star\n Can’t wait another second', [['An altar is a table in a church—offerings and sacrifices are made there for religious intentions. In an altar, mostly bread and wine are made sacred during communion services. People are eager to the donations and they want to  immediately offer and sacrifice items of theirs for God, using the metaphor “running” here.\n\n\n\nFor many Christian denominations, specifically those that believe that the bread and wine offered at the altar transform into Jesus Christ’s true body and blood, the altar is a place to encounter God. This is why Justin says he is running to the altar like a “track star,” a champion in the sport of track and field, a sport in running, since he is so eager to meet and spend time with God.\n\nThis may also be referencing Psalms 43:4:\n\nThen I will go to the altar of God,\nto God, my joy and my delight.\nI will praise you with the lyre,\nO God, my God.\n\nInterestingly, the next line refers to playing the lyre, a musical instrument, so this would be a fitting verse to interpolate into a song.\n\nAn altar is also used at a wedding (it’s the structure under which we commonly see the bride and groom affirm their love for one another and a priest pronounce them married). Justin could be talking about his rapid marriage to Hailey Baldwin; the two dated from 2015 to 2016, then reconciled in May of 2018 and got married within six months. Justin didn’t want to wait to marry Hailey; he was certain in his love for her and sought to do so as rapidly as possible, i.e. almost literally raced to the altar.']]), ('(Chance the Rapper)', [['Chance introduces himself in the same, suggestive tone he used when introducing his verse on “Confident” – the pair’s first collaboration, released over six years prior in 2013.\n\nThe track from Bieber’s Journals album saw moderate success, peaking at #41 in the United States, where it has since been certified platinum.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47YClVMlthI']]), ('But they don’t see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi', [['Desi Banks is a comedian, actor, and writer based in Atlanta, he is best known for his characters Parlay, Lil Johnny, Keisha, Grandma Reese, and Uncle Earl in his hilariously relatable online sketches.\n\nChance plays on the fact that even though Parlay plays a big role in the majority of Desi’s sketches, Parlay has never been seen on camera.']])]","['I already know this song is gonna slap, so hyped that we’re getting more new music from Justin!!', 'Already a banger', 'I know he made you a snack like Oscar Proud 👀 Chance The Rapper', 'holy isn’t just a song, holy is a religion, a lifestyle, a cultural reset, a motivation to live, the reason why i keep going and get out of bed every morning.', 'I know we believe in God, I know God believes in us – Chance The Rapper❤', 'If it comes close to Juke Jam & Confident we’re more than fine', 'I thought I’d never say it, but…\n\nJustin looks so cute with his hair.\nThe story makes me cry.\nThe lyrics it’s so deep.\nChance, puts a great spin on it.\nThe end of the video was so beautiful.\n\nI think I liked this.', 'Honestly, this smacked so hard of Jon Bellion that it wasn’t even funny.

In Judeo-Christian faiths, water plays a vital role in the ritual of Baptism, a rite that is symbolic of rebirth. The song’s theme bears similarities to those presented in his June 2018 collaborative project with Kid Cudi, titled KIDS SEE GHOSTS, such as the track “Reborn.”

Kanye and Ant have collaborated on several occasions prior to this song, namely on Ye’s June 2018 track “All Mine.” On the morning of Easter 2019, they debuted the song live at his Sunday Service Coachella event, with assistance from Ty Dolla $ign and the Sunday Service choir.","[('Let Your light reflect on me\n I promise I’m not hiding anything', [['Kanye is drawing on several themes throughout the Bible: the purity of God, depicted as light, and the futility of hiding sin from God.\n\nIn the gospel of Luke, Jesus talks about the need to keep our bodies “full of light” with no dark corners:\n\nYour eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness. See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.” (Luke 11: 34-36 NIV)\n\nAnd Jesus warns elsewhere that anything we think will remain hidden from God will, in fact, be shouted from the rooftops:\n\nThere is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs. (Luke 12:2-3 NIV).\n\nPsalm 32 talks about the value of confessing one’s sins to God, how it brings peace to the soul:\n\nBlessed is the one\nwhose sin the Lord does not count against them\n    and in whose spirit is no deceit. (Psalm 32:2 NIV)\n\nAnd finally, a proverb of Solomon rather neatly ties together this line with the song’s water imagery:\n\nAs water reflects the face,\n    so one’s life reflects the heart. (Proverbs 27:19 NIV)']]), ('Jesus is our rock', [[""In Christianity, Christ is often referred to as “The Rock,” which refers to the parable of the man who built his house on a rock. Matthew 7:24-27 reads:\n\nTherefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice\xa0is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.\xa0But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.\xa0The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.\n\nThe passage describes two men: one built his house on a rock and the other built his house on the sand. The house built on the rock describes a person who “builds” their life on Jesus' teachings, whereas the house built on the sand describes someone who “builds” their life in beliefs other than Jesus.\n\nJesus is also described as “The Rock” in Psalm 18:2:\n\nThe\xa0Lord\xa0is my rock,\xa0my fortress\xa0and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield\xa0and the horn of my salvation,\xa0my stronghold.\n\nAnd Psalm 62:2:\n\nTruly he is my rock\xa0and my salvation;\nhe is my fortress,\xa0I will never be shaken.""]]), ('Jesus, clean the music', [['In the days leading up to the album release, West’s pastor Adam Tyson stated that Kanye considered quitting rap because “it’s the devil’s music”.\n\n“One time, he told me that he wasn’t going to rap,” Tyson said. “I said, ‘Why not?‘” to which Kanye replied: “‘That’s the devil’s music.’ I said, ‘Hey, man. Rap is a genre. You can rap for God.’\n\nRap music, often infamously and including Kanye’s own music, contains profanity and lyrics referencing premarital sex –\xa0two topics considered to be sins in Christianity.\n\n\n\nJESUS IS KING is free of profanity and what could be called “sinful” lyrics. Instead, the album’s lyrics focuses purely on spreading the word of God. Songs like “New Body”, which ultimately did not make the album cut, were drastically altered to remove any sexual themes that would contradict the album’s gospel message.\n\nWest has only previously released one entirely clean album, 808s and Heartbreak (2008). Not only does it refer to Kanye cleansing and purifying his own music, but prays to Jesus to reform the music in current circulation.']]), ('Take the chlorine out our conversation', [['Chlorine is an element. It is often put into swimming pools to keep the water free of bacteria, but if ingested can be extremely harmful.\n\nAnt Clemons says that he eliminates the bacteria, or the meaninglessness, out of the conversation to demonstrate the fact that the “conversation” that is taking place is “pure”, similar to the filtration method that chlorine provides. This is demonstrated later in the chorus where Ant explains:\n\nI promise I’m not hiding anything\n\nThis is yet another Biblical allusion in the very religious album – much like Chlorine; in the Bible, Jesus purifies water.\n\nThis song particularly focuses on the symbolism of water. Kanye and Ant describe water as the physical manifestation of the concepts of ‘purity’ and perfection. In the religion of Christianity, Jesus is the only one to be described as perfect, stated in Peter 2:21-22.\n\nAnother common way to disinfect water is by using UV radiation, or light. In the next line, Ant Clemons says the following:\n\nLet Your light reflect on me\n\nThis could be a possible hidden message, saying that rather than using an industrial, scientific way to purify ourselves and our relationships, use the light of God and his purity to better our lives.']]), ('Jesus, heal the bruises', [['In Christanity, Jesus Christ gives people strength and even has the ability to heal the sick. This is depicted in various passages in the bible, including Matthew 9:35:\n\nJesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.']]), ('Jesus, please forgive', [['The name “Jesus” means ‘savior:’ someone that saves or rescues people. In this case, Jesus saves people from their sins.\n\nForgiveness is a large part of Christianity. According to the bible, when someone commits a sin, he/she can repent and be given forgiveness because of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. There is a plethora of bible passages which talk about forgiveness, an example being John 1:9:\n\nIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.']]), ('It’s water\n We are water\n Pure as water', [['In Judeo-Christian religions, water is used during ritual Baptism, which represents rebirth or purification. Kanye visited this topic before, in an April 2018 Twitter post:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989154899140096000?lang=en\n\nHe also tweeted something similar in December 2018:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1073445021456719872?lang=en\n\nHe may also be referencing John 4:13, 14 which reads:\n\nIn answer Jesus said to her: “Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again. 14  Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all,+ but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.”']]), ('The storm may come\n But we’ll get through it because of Your love', [['Storms are sometimes used to represent obstacles in life, a concept established in Psalm 107:28-29:\n\nHe maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.\n\nAnother biblical example can be found in three out of the four Gospels, when Jesus Christ calmed the storm. The story appears in Mark 4:35-41:\n\nHe got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, ‘Quiet! Be still!’ Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.\n\nInterestingly, in July 2019 a leaked Kanye West track surfaced, titled “The Storm.” It was presumed to be from the previously cancelled Yandhi tracklist. The song ended up being the sixth track on Jesus Is King, titled “Everything We Need.”']])]","['GODDAMN you Genius transcribers are fast.

This track is an updated version of the scrapped Yandhi track, “Law of Attraction.” While the two share many similarities, noticeable differences include a different chorus and vocals from the aforementioned rap duo. It also removes the original vocals from Ant Clemons, a then rising artist who was heavily involved in the creation of the original Yandhi.

This track marks the first joint effort between No Malice and Pusha T since No Malice’s August 2013 track “Shame the Devil.”","[('Caught with a trunk of Barry Manilows\n They sing a different tune when the slammer close', [[""Barry Manilow is an award-winning singer-songwriter and producer.\n\n\n\nIt’s not unheard of for dealers to use celebrities' names as slang for certain drugs; especially ones that come in powder form. For example Miley Cyrus has become synonymous with MDMA, while both Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were used interchangeably as code for crack and cocaine. The term “white girl” is also common.\n\nNo Malice uses Manilow’s name in a similar way, playing on his known affinity for showtunes and the phrase “sing a different tune,” denoting a tendency to snitch once someone is behind bars.""]]), ('They all say they real ’til it’s time to appraise it\n I seen them come and go, you only the latest\n But who am I to judge?

The concept of being “real” or earning “street cred” is a significant part of hip-hop history.\n\nPusha also plays on the idea of judgment—perhaps in the religious sense of the word—using Las Vegas as a metaphor for his own shortcomings. Interestingly, he also has a song called “Alone In Vegas,” which appeared on his debut mixtape, Fear of God, released in October 2011.']]), ('How could He not be the greatest?\n In my bed, under covers when undercovers had raided\n My presence is happy belated\n Fashionably late, I’m just glad that you made it\n The best is yet to come, I’m just glad that you waited', [['Pusha T is well known for his coke lines and history of drug dealing. He juxtaposes his success as an artist and vice president of G.O.O.D. Music with his previous position in life—one of vulnerability as a pusher of illegal substances—attributing his good fortune here to the titular Jesus Christ. This comparison sparks some wordplay between the word “undercover,” meaning a clandestine government agent, and the image of being comfortable under a blanket.\n\nWhile there is no record of a federal drug raid orchestrated against the rapper, he has discussed hypothetical scenarios throughout his extensive catalog. For example, on March 2011’s “Raid” he says:\n\nEvery time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit\nFolks rush in, three letters try and stop it\nF-B-I-R-S, D-E-A']]), ('A lot of damaged souls, I done damaged those\n And in my arrogance, took a camera pose', [['Echoing some of the sentiments his younger brother, Pusha T, expressed on his latest album Daytona, No Malice confesses that his past history of drug dealing has ruined the lives of those who were consumers of his product.\n\nPusha T infamously used the photo of Whitney Houston’s bathroom at the height of her drug addiction for his Daytona album cover.\n\n\n\nAlthough Push did not offer an explanation for why the photo was chosen, it may be clarified by his brother’s line here. While drug dealing offered an avenue to opulence and financial success, it ruined the lives of many, including Whitney Houston.\n\nHowever, No Malice is ashamed that his arrogance caused him to repress the feeling of guilt of damaging the lives of others and continue living the life of a celebrity in front of a camera.\n\nThis sentiment, along with fear of being caught by law enforcement, lead No Malice to retire as a rapper. Like Kanye, he later mended his relationship with God and started recording gospel music.']]), ('Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost', [['No Malice’s brother, Pusha T, and Kanye collaborated on the 2013 song “Hold On” which explores the tribulations of sinning and losing faith while trying to survive in disenfranchised environments.\n\nWhen one of them begins to lose faith, Push and No Malice always have each other to lean on.']]), ('They give you Wraith talk, I give you faith talk', [['The Wraith is an iconic car model made by British automobile manufacturer Rolls Royce. The car is frequently mentioned in hip-hop and can be seen referenced in the tracks of rappers like Takeoff and Meek Mill, who flex the car as a sign of wealth due to its enormous price tag.\n\nHowever, No Malice contradicts the materialistic ideologies given off by these rappers by explicitly stating that this track and record are from a pure, spiritual standpoint.']]), ('Blindfolded on this road, watch me faith walk', [['No Malice compares himself to the likes of Saul, who was blinded by a grand light on the way to Damascus, recorded in Acts 9:3:\n\nAnd as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven.\n\nThrough this journey, he aims to “walk by faith,” a phrase from 2 Corinthians 5:7-8 meaning to fully depend on God:\n\n7 For we walk by faith, not by sight. 8 We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.\n\nNote that the story of Saul’s transformation into a devout Christian was one inspirational element for Kanye’s 2016 album The Life of Pablo.']]), ('From the concrete grew a rose', [[""No Malice alludes to 2Pac’s famous lyrical poem, “The Rose That Grew From Concrete,” from his posthumous November 2000 album of the same name. The poem is an allegory about finding unlikely success in spite of a troubled past:\n\nThe rose, it grew from concrete\nKeepin' all these dreams\nProvin' nature’s laws wrong\nIt learned how to walk without havin' feet\n\nNo Malice also employs the imperfect homonym of “Rolls” (compared with “rose”) to foreshadow the next bar, which references the Wraith, a car model made by Rolls Royce.""]]), ('We call on Your blessings\n In the Father, we put our faith\n King of the kingdom\n Our demons are tremblin’\n Holy angels defendin’\n In the Father, we put our faith', [['In James 1:17, the writer shares all blessings come from God and Him only:\n\nEvery good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.\n\nKanye brings up both sides of the spiritual battle: demons, who are angels that have rebelled against God and serve Satan, and angels, who are servants of God, the King of the kingdom. James 2:19 gives us a picture of demons, trembling in fear of the almighty God:\n\nYou believe that there is one God. You do well.

The armor of God is a metaphorical image of protection in spiritual warfare, seen in Ephesians 6:10-18. The specific pieces of the armor are synonyms for the gospel truths.\n\nVerses 11-17 encourage Christians to fight the battle against the devil and his evil schemes with the gospel, specifically using the armor of God:\n\n11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\n\nMatthew 7:13-14 talks about the difficult road to heaven:\n\n13 Enter by the narrow gate.

The track features gospel singer Fred Hammond.

The track was first previewed by Kanye at his Fox Theatre performance on September 27, 2019, where he announced Fred would be featuring on the track.","[('Told the devil that I’m going on a strike', [['Kanye could be making a reference here to The Temptation Of Christ, which is a story from the bible describing how Jesus went into the desert and fasted from food for 40 days, while the Devil tempted him to turn stones into bread. This likely means that Kanye is telling the devil that even though he has been working for him his whole life, that now he is going to go on a hunger strike, and the devil still wont be able to tempt him. This of course all symbolizes the fact that he is leaving his old secular and indulgent ways behind to become more Christ-like, and that he will not be tempted back into a life of sin.']]), ('Hold it down, all fallen down', [['Possible reference to his 2004 song ‘All Falls Down’ where in the chorus he says “when it falls down who you gon call now?”\nBy saying “all fallen down” he can be saying that all his issues he’s been dealing with are finally taking a fatal toil on his mental.\nIn the song he asks “ who you gon call now… when it all falls down”.And in the song he never got a definite answer who will be there for him in his darkest hour.\nHe could be impying that he realized hes the only person that can be there for him at the end, another illusion to the theme of existential loneliness .\nAt the end he still pleads for someone to pray for him and save him from his thoughts.']]), ('Change, he ain’t really different', [['This is a double (maybe triple) entendre that goes with the previous line.\n\n1) This is how onlookers refer to those that have gone through the BS “Born-Again Christian” experience just to save face in some aspect of his/her life. This is what some will inevitably say about Ye.\n\n2) Ye is telling us that his least favorite thing is a hypocrite.  He is also letting us know that, although he has been down a crazy path, his message has remained unchanged. Do not forget that this man’s first single was “Jesus Walks”.\n\n3) Although things have changed drastically since Jesus walked the earth, the message from God remains the same.']]), ('Man, you’re never seein’ home and you never see the domes', [['The domes built on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and in particular the Dome of The Rock are icons of Jerusalem in the modern mind. These domes were built by Muslims starting in the 7th century but visually they have come to be synonymous with Jerusalem.\n\n\n\nEzekiel 5:5 So said the Lord God: This is Jerusalem; in the midst of the nations I have placed it, and around it are lands.\n\nJerusalem is considered in Scripture to be the center of the world.\n\nIn this lyric, Kanye says that Christians have made him feel like he has been cast out of his home and cast out from Jerusalem to the outskirts of the world.']]), ('To sing of change', [['Most will be skeptical that Kanye is changing nor believe Kanye has changed. However, most Christians know change is difficult and slow. Becoming Christian doesn’t instantly grant you a new brain that knows all the teachings of Christ. Christian means following Jesus, which means taking up the cross of crucifixion by those whom you are trying to save, and desiring to become like Jesus, which means perfection. This can only be achieved by the aid of the Holy Spirit and via the deep knowledge of Christ’s infinite forgiveness so you can aim for infinite heights like perfection. Without Christ, this is impossible. Philippians 1:21-24, If one isn’t interested in that, they define themselves as no longer Christian.']]), ('Only if they knew what I knew, uh\n I was never new ’til I knew of', [['Following the previous line where he is called a “halfway believer,” Kanye states that he was never “new” until he knew the True and living God. Therefore, prior to fully knowing God and accepting Jesus Christ as his savior, he had not yet died to himself and born again in Jesus.  While he may have been dabbling in Christian themes and beliefs, he himself was not yet “new” and therefore remained susceptible to incongruous behaviors.']]), ('We get called halfway believers\n Only halfway read Ephesians', [[""Many who profess their faith publicly in Jesus are incorrectly judged based on past behaviors and not viewed as “fully” Christian, as if their faith is a work in process or merely an act.  Kanye is noting that he is considered by some as a “halfway” believer, which is technically impossible.\n\nThe book of Ephesians is roughly halfway through the New Testament and largely deals with how the gospel story affects believers' everyday lives.  The first half of Ephesians (chapter 1-3) are mainly theological (belief), the second half (4-6) is more life application (practice). Kanye may be stating that he is still working through the application of his faith to his everyday life.""]]), ('Nothing worse than a hypocrite', [['Kanye has been called a hypocrite by the Christian community for having an explicit, materialistic discography while claiming to be a Christian.\n\nThis line can be viewed from either Kanye’s perspective: that he is denouncing being a hypocrite, or the Christian perspective: Kanye is referencing this to point out how he is treated even though JESUS IS KING is a clearly gospel-oriented album.']]), ('[Verse 1: Kanye West]', [['Multiple lines in this verse have drawn parallels to lines in Drake’s contribution on Travis Scott’s 2018 track “SICKO MODE.” In his second verse on the track, Drake supposedly disses and threatens Kanye.\n\nFor example, the first line of this verse draws very many similarities to Drake’s line:\n\n\nCut out all the lights, He the light (Kanye)\n\nCut the lights (Yeah, what?), paid the price (Yeah) (Drake)\n\n\nAnother example include of parallelism is:\n\n\nMade a left when I should’ve made a right (Kanye)\n\nI crept down the block (Down the block)\nMade a right (Yeah, right) (Drake)\n\n\nA final example is:\n\n\nTold the devil when I see him, on sight (Kanye)\n\nNiggas think it’s sweet (Nah, never), it’s on sight (Yeah, what?)

Because she has committed adultery, she is required by law to wear a scarlet “A” on her chest for the rest of her life to show that she is an adulteress. Prynne is also forced to stand on a scaffold for three hours to be ridiculed and shamed by the townspeople.\n\nThroughout the novel, Prynne’s husband searches for the identity of the father of her child so that he could have revenge. Both singers seemingly allude to this when they ask, “who’s the other girl?” Similarly, the pearl mentioned in the chorus may be an allusion to Hester’s daughter, Pearl, who is a constant reminder of her “sin.” In addition, in chapter 7 of the novel, Pearl is portrayed as “the scarlet letter endowed with life,” which was a description of her red dress. As the singers have confirmed that the song is about a cheating partner, these lines also reflect their dislike and distrust of their partner.\n\nLater in the novel, the “A” that Hester is forced to wear comes to stand for “able” instead of “adultery,” removing all the negative connotations of the letter. Prynne later voluntarily wears the “A,” as it now signifies dignity and grace instead of guilt. She artistically embroiders the “A” into her clothing, which many people come to admire. This idea of dignity ties in with the theme of the song, which Halsey explained in an interview with The Boot:\n\n…there’s so much music in the world about cheating partners…People wanna pin it on the other girl, and make it the other girl’s fault, so it was so cool for us to be coming together and being like, “You know what? Forget him. We’re not gonna hate each other.” To be clear, this is a fictional event. But just us representing those two sides of women in the equation, being like, “No, we’re not gonna let misogyny turn us against each other, instead we’re empowered.”\n\n\n\nHalsey wearing a shirt with the scarlet “A” from “The Scarlet Letter”']])]","['There voices sound so good together.

The track exhibits Logic and Eminem’s rapid-fire flows. The title seems to assert that they are lyrically murdering their detractors and non-lyrical rappers.

In a 2018 interview with HardKnockTV, Logic shared his thoughts on Eminem and his desire to collaborate with him:

It was awesome […] to be recognized by one of my favorite MCs of all time, one of my favorite artists […] I fuck with him. I want to work with him. I want to do a song with him. I think that could be pretty cool.","[('Big bills like a platypus', [['“Big bills” refers to having a lot of money, as Eminem acknowledges in the previous line, while a platypus is an Australian animal noted for its duck-like bill.']]), ('You gon’ make Bobby attack\n You gon’ make Bobby Boy snap\n You gon’ make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)', [['Logic’s legal name is Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, but he goes by Bobby—a common nickname for Robert. Logic released a mixtape in 2016 under the moniker Bobby Tarantino, and a sequel in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, Logic also changed the name of his record label, originally Elysium Records, to BobbyBoy Records. This joint venture with Def Jam includes artists John Lindahl, Damian Lemar Hudson, Big Lenbo, Kajo and Silas. When discussing the change on social media, Logic said:\n\nI really feel like BobbyBoy has become an empire. From books, film, television, and it’s just been a beautiful creative space. And I want that name and brand to mean something, so I’d rather have all of my endeavors, kind of, in one place.']]), ('Your shit is ass like a tailbone', [['A tailbone refers to the coccyx.

Specifically on “5AM,” he raps:\n\nThese rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive\n\nHe also utilizes the idiom “like a moth to a flame,” which concerns being attracted to things that are destructive.""]]), ('Or you’re trapped in your cell phone\n Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe', [['“Chicken scratch” is a slang term for writing. It’s sometimes hard for others to read it. Eminem mentioned his chicken scratch before on October 2013’s “Rap God”:\n\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes']]), ('I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep’s clothes', [['A repossession occurs when an owner of a vehicle misses too many payments on his car loan, and the bank that issued the loan comes to take the car. “Toes” is a homophone of “tows,” and connects to the repo man, who typically tows the car away.\n\n\n\nEminem also plays on the phrase “a wolf in sheep’s clothing”—someone who appears nice but has ill intent. However, the Behemoth—a creature found in Job 40:15, is much larger.']]), ('From the East Coast to the West, I’m the ethos and I’m the G.O.A.T\n Who the best, I don’t gotta say a fuckin’ thing, though\n ’Cause MCs know', [['Fans and media outlets like HipHopDX consider Eminem to be one of the “Greatest Of All Time.” In fact, Neilson Soundscan named him the “Artist of the Decade” between 2000 and 2009.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, “ethos” means the ‘spirit of a culture, era, or community,’ and it’s also one of the Aristotelian modes of persuasion—the appeal to authority. An ‘ethos’ argument attempts to convey that the speaker is credible because of his status, skills, or experience. It may also be worth noting that a ‘logos’ argument is one that applies logic, or an appeal to reason.']]), ('Y’all couldn’t hold a candle at a prayer vigil\n When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin’ air duct', [['“Can’t hold a candle” is an idiom that dates back to the 1600s, when incompetent apprentices who lacked coordination couldn’t hold a candelabra properly for their master to see things in the dark. In modern times, the phrase means that one thing doesn’t compare to another.\n\nEm also compares his venting—which is the act of releasing stress or anger through words or actions—to a ventilation system, which never stops releasing air.']]), ('Fuck rap', [['Logic first expressed this distaste for the hip-hop community on his November 2015 song “City of Stars,” and again on his September 2018 song “ICONIC”:\n\nReal talk, fuck rap\nI hate and I love it ‘cause it’s so negative\nEverybody selfish, nobody wanna give\nA helping hand to the next man, well, fuck you then']]), ('Hol’ up, I said “Rover” because now your Rover is red\n Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant\n But I roll over my opponents instead', [['These bars may relate to Suge Knight, who ran over two men in March 2015 while driving a red Ford Raptor, which some media outlets mistook to be a red Range Rover.\n\nRed Rover is a game where people hold hands and an opponent runs in between the linked hands in an attempt to breakthrough. If the player breaks through, he can take either of the two people, whose link he broke, back to his team. If he fails to break the link, he must remain on the side where he failed. The game ends when one side has all the players.\n\nRover is also a common dog name, and dogs perform tricks like roll over.']])]","['Logic and Eminem in the booth like:', 'It’s 🔥🔥🔥\nBut the outro is going to get SO annoying after a couple of listens.\n😂', 'Both be like', ""Chris D'Elia outro had me weak 😂"", 'holy s h i t', 'This is a LEGENDARY collaboration!', 'what the fuck just happened', 'Maaaaan\nmy ears just got pregnant', 'i hope the outro got removed in the album version just sayin', 'Lets pray for this beat because it got slaughtered by Lyrical assassins.', 'You using too many napkins.

https://twitter.com/maroon5/status/1001866378100359168

Leaving the original vocals & production intact, Cardi adds a Bronx-flavored verse to the pop record, rapping about having danced for dollars & being the life of the party among other things.

The remix also gained its own music video featuring several idolized women across an array of fields.

In September 2018, the song topped the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Cardi’s third #1 single, and Maroon5’s fourth. The song dethroned the uber-popular “In My Feelings”, by Drake, which led the pack for ten weeks.

On February 11, 2019, “Girls Like You” logged its 33rd week in the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the sixth single in the chart’s history to stay in the top 10 for that long. The song currently matches Ed Sheeran’s 33-week run of “Shape of You” in the top 10.","[('Know it’s really real if I let you meet my mama (Eeoow)', [['Usually when couples meet each other’s parents things seem to be getting serious.']]), ('I don’t play when it comes to my heart, let’s get it though', [['Carbi B already made a similar statement in her song “Be Careful"":\n\nBe careful with me, do you know what you doin\'?\nWhose feelings that you’re hurtin\' and bruisin\'?']]), ('I’m sure them other girls were nice enough\n But you need someone to spice it up\n So who you gonna call?

The song was released as the album’s second single on November 19, 2020, a week before the album’s release.

The song, which interpolates Olivia Newton-John’s 1981 track “Physical” (just like the Dua Lipa track of the same name), is about being in an abusive or controlling relationship in which one person manipulates the other to stay, causing them to feel like a prisoner.

“Prisoner” was also included on Future Nostalgia – The Moonlight Edition, the re-issue of Dua Lipa’s highly successful sophomore album. The re-issue was released on February 12th, 2021 via Warner Records, and is featured as the fourteenth track of the record.","[('I tasted Heaven, now I can’t live without it\n I can’t forget you and your love is the loudest', [['This is not the first time Miley has hinted that she has tasted the sweetest love.

Their relationship lasted for almost 10 years, and several magazines has named them “the cutest” when together.\n\n\n\nTherefore, it is safe to say that these lines where Miley implies that “their love is the loudest” may be a reference to her longest and most enduring relationship (since in the end of the accompanying music video, she gives a nod to her exes, meaning that the lyrics were inspired by her personal life).']]), ('I try to replace it with city lights', [[""While Dua provides vocals for this line, it bears a striking similarity to Cyrus' 2019 hit “Slide Away,” written about her breakup with ex-husband Liam Hemsworth:\n\nBack to the ocean, I’ll go back to the city lights\n\nDua emphasizes how she tried to replace her feelings towards him by returning to the city-scene and lose herself in energetic moments.""]])]","['I USED TO BE A FAN.

The Southern pair rap about how there’s no better match for them in a defensive delivery.

From the moment Megan Thee Stallion and Moneybagg Yo went public with their relationship, they haven’t been shy when it comes to showing off their affections toward one another. The rappers often take to their social media pages to fawn over each other, so it didn’t surprise fans when they announced that they were joining lyrical forces to drop a collaborative effort.

The pair released their single “All Dat” at the stroke of midnight on Thursday morning, accompanied by a music video. The only people in the video and Megan and Moneybagg as they enjoy spending one-on-one time together in an expansive, luxury, hilltop home. On the track, they each go verse for NSFW verse as they drop bars about what they like to do to—receive from—the other in the bedroom.","[('If you gettin’ to a bag, you the hot girl type (Hey)', [[""To get a “bag” is to make money.

This song also serves as the lead single to NAV’s third studio album, Good Intentions.

The title of this song refers to Turks & Caicos, which are a group of islands that are located southeast of the British Overseas Territory. The three artists tell a rags-to-riches story over the Wheezy-produced upbeat tune, discussing the transition from them being poor to eventually living a lavish lifestyle. They drop references to many expensive items that they possess, including cars, drugs, jewelry, weaponry, and women.

This song’s official music video premiered on NAV’s YouTube channel three days after its release, on March 30, 2020. Young Thug, a close friend and frequent collaborator of the three artists, makes a cameo appearance. The video was directed by NAV’s XO Records founder and manager, Amir “Cash” Esmailian.","[('She sweet, I was movin’ off a Perc’\n I bought her a Birk’ and a birthday cake (Birthday cake)', [['Birkin, a French luxury fashion goods manufacturer, was founded by Thierry Hermès, who also owns the French luxury brand Hermès.\n\nGunna has expressed his love for the bag countless time on tracks such as “Hot”, “Pink Toes” and “Vibes on Vibes” while also naming a song, “Baby Birkin”, after the accessory.\n\n\n\nJordyn Woods with a Birkin bag in Gunna\'s ""Baby Birkin"" music video']]), ('Twenty racks don’t feel like nothin’ to me', [['A “rack” is a thousand dollars so “twenty racks” is $20,000.

As a teenager, Urie’s parents were afraid for his future as a starving artist. Having reached financial stability as a musician, Urie tips his hat to his mother, and reflects on his journey to success, examining the thirst of record labels for new material and the quest to avoid people, who only want to be associated with him due to his fame.","[('Hey look ma, I made it\n Hey look ma, I made it', [['These lyrics make up the title of the track. The repeated six words represent Urie saying he has “made it” in the music industry. Often, new artists will be struggling in the industry, and it is quite tough to “make it” and become a successful musician. Brendon’s parents were likely worried that this would happen to him early on, as it does to most who attempt to make a career for themself out of music. However, he ended up becoming famous and successful, which is what most of the song describes. He is finally able to show his parents and the world that he “made it” despite all of the hardships he may have faced.\nOne could also take these lyrics sarcastically or ironically. Throughout the track, Urie portrays the message of what happens after fame in a tongue-in-cheek manner. The music video shows a puppet taking the place of Brendon as a clear metaphor of others using him as a puppet rather than a human. Many lyrics give sarcastic praise to the effects of fame, which are not in reality valid. He could be saying, “Hey look ma, I made it” as a way of ironically saying that yes, he may have become successful in the industry, but a lot of things are messed up. The cheery sound of the lyrics and tune could lead one to take it all literally, but along with the music video, which shows the puppet version of Brendon progressively getting more messed up, taking drugs, drinking, getting beaten, arrested, and puking. Throughout these visuals, the happy sounding lyrics create a stark contrast, which could also leave the listener to interpret the lyrics sarcastically.']]), ('So I do the deed, get up and leave\n A climber and a sadist, yeah', [['“Doing the deed” is an idiom for sex. These lines continue the analogy of Urie as a hooker working for the record label.']]), ('Ain’t ready for the latest?', [['This speaks about how the fans weren’t ready for the new album. No one knew anything until a few months before the release. Even the record label that he was with said he should just take the year off. Brendon said that he couldn’t just sit still, and worked on songs in-between shows playing Charlie in the Broadway musical Kinky Boots. He would work on his computer during the show, and produced 2 songs.']]), ('I see it, I want it, I take it, take it', [['This line is similar to one in “Emperor’s New Clothes” from Death of a Bachelor.\n\nI see what’s mine and take it\n\nBoth lines evoke the idea of Brendon identifying what he wants out of life and doing what’s necessary to gain it.']]), ('And if you lose, boo-hoo', [['Boo-hoo is a phrase meaning “to cry.” In this context, “boo-hoo” carries a sarcastic connotation, as a way to express a lack of sympathy toward someone, who is behaving overly dramatic, and mock them.\n\nBrendon is ready to take on the next chapter of his life. He is prepared to face challenges and rise above them. If other people have a problem with losing, that’s on them.\n\nIn “Emperor’s New Clothes”, Brendon expresses a similar idea in the lyrics\n\nFinders keepers, losers weepers']]), ('This world is full of demons stocks\n And bonds and bible traders', [['Stocks and bonds are two ways to make money in the world of investing. Buying a stock in a company now gives the buyer a share in that company while buying a bond entails long-term debt.\n\nBrendon equates the ills of the financial system with those who use religion for self-profit. They are the prominent examples of “demons” in today’s world. This directly links with the main theme of the album’s title to Pray For The Wicked.\n\n“Bible traders” is reminiscent of the short story “Good Country People” by Flannery O\'Connor, in which a bible salesman tricks a young amputee into giving him her prosthetic leg and subsequently leaves her on the roof of a barn. Brendon’s use of a bible trader could point to a record label that seems helpful and wholesome but is ultimately indifferent to the artists they represent.\n\n“Bible traders ""could also be wordplay also saying Bible Traitors, meaning people who abandoned their religion for a secular lifestyle, or even the notorious traitor, Judas Iscariot.']]), ('‘Cause I’m a hooker sellin’ songs and\n My pimp’s a record label', [[""A pimp is most well known as:\n\na man who controls prostitutes and arranges clients for them, taking part of their earnings in return.\n\nPimps are also well known for their almost ownership status of their women, often taking advantage of them for personal gain. In this lyric, Brendon is describing his relationship with the recording industry, often taking advantage of artist’s skills for their own benefit.\n\nIn an interview with GQ, Urie discusses balancing the personal and business relationship with his label and the “hooker sellin' songs lyric.\n\nThat’s just real. I can write these things because I’m good friends with people at my label. We’ve been able to talk and learn from those experiences. Things like that are tongue in cheek, but I’m not totally bullshitting there. I have felt like that in the past until I took control creatively and business-wise. I can make decisions and not just throw myself into the corner. I’m a hooker selling songs: I’m a glorified shirt salesman.

Here, the biblical original sin takes place and Man is thrown out of paradise as\npunishment.\n\nRather than Urie being the greatest in the Garden of Eden, which would suggest his being holy or pure, he reigns over the garden of evil, indicating Urie’s tongue-in-cheek rejection of religion.\n\n\n\nThe Garden of Eden']]), ('Some are loyal soldiers while\n These other thorns are rosy', [['Is the cup half empty or half full?

Having high hopes is a phrase that means to have:

a strong feeling that something good will happen or be true

Throughout Panic! At The Disco’s and Brendon Urie’s career, the band has faced challenges and changes. The beginning of Panic!’s journey was fraught with financial challenges. Brendon Urie, trying to make ends meet, worked in a Smoothie King to support his music career. While creating their iconic “I Write Sins Not Tragedies”, the band could not afford to pay professional string musicians, leaving them to record a middle school band member playing the part one note at a time.

Even with commercial success, the trials of the music industry still plagued the band. From band members leaving and attempting to adapt to a turbulent music scene, Brendon Urie has seen his dream of maintaining success in the music industry fade in and out of view. Despite these difficulties, Urie, now the last remaining member of the band, has continued to strive for his goals and has earned a Grammy nomination, a stint on the Broadway show Kinky Boots, and numerous other accolades.

Upon the song’s release, Brendon revealed his inspiration behind “High Hopes” on Twitter and Instagram, and in the video description on YouTube

I spent too long not setting my expectations high enough, worried about how it felt to fail. I hit a point when I realized I had to aim high and fail, fail, fail in order to keep growing. This one is for all of you who helped me go for it all. I thank you.
- B

The song was released half an hour prior to the due time – 2pm EST – on the official Panic! At The Disco YouTube Channel, racking up just over 1k views, before being officially released via a separate video, and on Spotify.

“High Hopes” is the third single released from Pray For The Wicked. It was preceded by “Say Amen (Saturday Night)” and “(Fuck a) Silver Lining” which were released two months earlier.

“High Hopes” is the highest charting song in Panic! At the Disco history, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, surpassing “I Write Sins Not Tragedies” at number 7 in 2006.","[('Stay up on that rise\n Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh\n Stay up on that rise\n Stay up on that rise and never come down', [['Figuratively, staying on a rise means pushing yourself towards success. If you’re always going up, you’ll never have to fall. Ideally, musical artists would like to be at the peak of their careers all the time.\n\nOf course, the lines can also be taken literally. With a literal understanding, one can’t help but to think of the song’s music video.\n\nIn the video, Brendon climbs the side of a skyscraper, also known as a “high-rise” building . Once he reaches the roof, Brendon joins the rest of the band to play the rest of the song. Their playing on top of the skyscraper in the music video could be seen as a symbol of Panic! At The Disco’s recent mainstream success. With that interpretation, one could see the onlookers watching Brendon climb from the ground to the roof as the fans of Panic! At The Disco who have stuck with the band since its early days.']]), ('[Chorus]', [['Brendon revealed at the YouTube Live Release Party for Pray for the Wicked that the chorus for “High Hopes” was the first chorus written for the album.\n\n[The chorus] was given to me by a friend [named] Ilsey. She had this whole idea […] and the perfect message. […] It felt just how I wanted to iterate to people about my childhood, making cardboard cutouts of guitars and acting like a rock star.']]), ('So I got one more run and it’s gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh', [['Some people have interpreted this lyric to mean that Pray for the Wicked will be the last Panic! At The Disco album. Brendon Urie addressed this idea in an interview with NME, expressing his desire to continue Panic! for a long time.\n\n[When writing the lyric] I didn’t take it that way, but who knows. I’m so impulsive. I could say that this will never be the last, but I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. […] I don’t have any plans to stop, ever, anytime soon. I want to be like Mick Jagger’s age and still doing it. That’s the dream!']]), ('It’s uphill for oddities\n The stranger crusaders, ain’t ever wannabes\n The weird and the novelties don’t ever change', [['Panic! at the Disco’s introduction into and approach within the music industry has been far from conventional.\n\nAs one of the first bands to garner recognition and success through the internet, they were non-conformists in an industry with deep-rooted conventions and expectations, and instead of having little commercial success, they took the world by storm as “stranger crusaders.”\n\nThroughout commercial radio’s musical eras characterized by the dominance of hip hop and pop, Panic! has always opted for “the weird and the novelties” instead. Notably switching from the pop punk and vaudevillian theatrics of their debut, A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out, to the flower crowns and Beatles-inspired psychedelic and baroque pop of their sophomore album, Pretty. Odd., Panic! takes pride in their label as “oddities.”\n\nBy following their own interests and disregarding the pressure of their contemporaries, Panic! established a precedent of never giving up in environments that only seem to ostracize them and of never changing themselves at the expense of their quirks and creativity.']]), ('They say it’s all been done but they haven’t seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh', [['Throughout Brendon Urie and Panic! At The Disco’s career, the band has continually changed genre and shifted the status quo. From the 60’s inspired psychedelia of Pretty. Odd. to the electronic, club synths of Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die, Panic! has delved into a new sound with each album.\n\nThough some may believe that Panic! has done everything that is possible for a band to do, Brendon Urie believes that only the best is yet to come for Panic!.\n\nThe phrase ‘but they haven’t seen the best of me’ is also reminiscent of a lyric in “This is Gospel,” which states ‘but they haven’t seen the best of us yet.’']]), ('Museum victories, every day', [['“Museum victories” refers to paintings of battles that are often housed in art museums. Rulers or military officers would often commission artwork to commemorate their great victories These works of art are typically over the top in their depictions, portraying the victors as shining heroes.\n\nBy striving for “museum victories”, Urie continues the theme of seeking out the very best in everything that he does: achieving goals so great that they deserve to have commemorative paintings commissioned in their honor.\n\n\n\nJohn Singleton Copley, The Death of Major Peirson, 1783']]), ('Manifest destiny, back in the days\n We wanted everything, wanted everything', [['The Manifest Destiny was a belief held by 19th-century American settlers that it was their God-given right – or destiny – to settle westward.\n\n‘Manifest destiny’ in the context of “High Hopes” refers to the view that Brendon was destined to be a musician and share his craft with the world.\n\n\n\nAmerican Progress, (1872) by John Gast, is an allegorical representation of the modernization of the new west.']]), ('Didn’t have a dime but I always had a vision', [['In the early days of Panic! At The Disco, the band had very little money– only big passions and dreams in music. Their lack of funds can be especially noted in their first album, and most notably in their single “I Write Sins Not Tragedies.”\n\nIn an interview on the Zach Sang Show, Brendon shared:\n\nWe had ten thousand dollars to do the first album, we had like no money. […] At that point, we couldn’t even get an extra two hundred dollars to pay someone in to come and play trumpet. We had to pay a sixth grader to come in and play trumpet and we recorded each note separately. So if you listen to “I Write Sins Not Tragedies,” first single off first album, we recorded a girl who was, you know, 13, 14 years old, playing cello one note at a time. And we just took them and sampled them basically, played it like an MPC. So we actually did that like, by hand. It was really crazy.\n\nDespite having little money to keep their band and themselves personally afloat, their vision of achieving success was enough to sustain them.\n\nThis line also calls back to a similar lyric in “(Fuck A) Silver Lining”:\n\nWas lost in thought but held the vision\n\nThis lyric refers to Brendon possibly being overwhelmed or lost, but ultimately remaining set on his goal.']]), ('Burn your biographies\n Rewrite your history,', [['A biography is a work of writing that outlines a person’s experiences and includes intimate details of their life.\n\nThe biography mentioned in the lyrics can easily be equated to Panic!’s discography. Throughout Panic!’s career, they have continually ‘burn[ed]’ and ‘rewrit[ten]’ themselves. Each album has been a completely different genre, from the 60’s style of Pretty.

Post discusses the way that mainstream fame has impacted his relationships and how he responds to the disloyalty, while DaBaby raps about his newfound success and sends a warning shot to his enemies.

DaBaby teased a portion of his verse and a snippet of the chorus on his Instagram account, an hour before the album’s release.

This track marks the first time that either Post Malone and DaBaby have worked together.","[('Laughin’ to the bank like ha, ha, ha', [['Here, Post is talking down on his critics who never thought he could make it as far as he has in the music industry. He is boasting about his wealth, blocking out the criticism as he goes to cash out what would probably be a very hefty check, considering his last LP went platinum.']]), ('When I was shit broke, couldn’t even buy smokes', [['This line is reminiscent of a lyric from Posty’s track “Sugar Wraith” off the 2018 album \u200bbeerbongs & bentleys.\n\nNicotine fiend, couldn’t even buy a pack, yeah']]), ('[Chorus: Post Malone]', [['The melody of the chorus is reminiscent of Rockwell’s 1984 #2 hit “Somebody’s Watching Me” featuring Michael Jackson. Both songs share a theme of paranoia and distrust. Interestingly, when Post’s Stoney spent its 77th week in the Top 10 of Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Album charts, it broke a 34-year record held by Jackson’s landmark album Thriller.']]), ('I just went double platinum with no features\n Just to show a nigga I don’t really need him', [['DaBaby boasts about the success of his featureless March 2019 breakout single, “Suge,” which peaked at #3 on the Hot 100 chart. The single was also certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA on July 16, 2019.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that DaBaby’s debut album Baby on Baby included features from four different rappers, such as Offset and Rich The Kid, but his solo songs “Suge” and “Goin Baby” performed better on the charts than those with a guest artist.']]), ('Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)\n Used to keep ’em close, now they dead to me (Damn)\n Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)\n Enemies, yeah, it’s so sad', [[""In the chorus, Post reflects on how his friends became his enemies when he achieved his newfound celebrity status.\n\nEarlier on 21 Savage’s “all my friends” off the album i am > i was, Post had similar lines:\n\nI lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe\n\nIt’s common for friends to turn into enemies after a fallout, especially if money is involved. Since Post began his music career and obtained new money, he has since separated himself from those old or untrustworthy friends that were only after his paychecks.\n\nOn his song “Paranoid” off his second studio album beerbongs & bentleys he reiterated this:\n\nEven family and friends started switchin'\nEver since I got that check, seen ‘em itchin’\nSometimes feel like I got no friends""]]), ('They’re packin’ the post and I’m home alone', [['Since DaBaby is on a Post Malone song, it makes sense that he would reference him in this line while interpolating the chorus from his breakout 2019 track, “Suge”:\n\nHah\nPack in the mail, it’s gone (Uh)\n\nMail stations are commonly referred to as post offices.\n\nDaBaby also references the classic 1990 film Home Alone starring Macaulay Culkin, which IMDB describes as:\n\nAn eight-year-old troublemaker must protect his house from a pair of burglars when he is accidentally left home alone by his family during Christmas vacation.\n\n\n\nThe phrase “Home Alone” is also used as a homophone here. Because DaBaby refers to Posty earlier in the line, “Home Alone” can also sound like “Home Malone,” especially since he pauses in between the two words.']]), ('Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin’\n And I’ma rake ’em in a pile, throw ’em in a bag\n Tie them bitches up and leave ’em', [[""DaBaby is frustrated with the fake friends on his team and suggests that a lot of friendships are merely short term. He compares his friends to the autumn leaves (with the double meaning for leavin' in the first line), which fall off their trees each year in preparation for the winter. Like fake friends, the leaves begin to show their true colors before they fall from the tree, which unveils their deceptive nature. Baby continues the simile by “raking his friends into a pile”, which is the method used to dispose of leaves once they break off their trees.""]])]","['I just went double platinum with no features\nJust to show a nigga, I ain’t really need him\n\nDaBaby is indisputably ROTY.

The track also marks his first single of 2019 and the first collaboration between Post and Young Thug. Throughout the song, Post sings about troubles with a girl and expresses his desire to remove her from his life, while Thug’s part seems to suggest that he’s trying to reconnect with a girl, which is in complete contrast to the rest of the song.

The music video for the track features Post being stabbed and killed in the very beginning. Throughout the remainder of the video, a zombified Post emerges from his grave and walks around the Wild West-like town where he comes across Young Thug singing to the same crowd that killed him earlier on. There, he confronts the girl who left him behind originally, which could be a reference to Post’s ex-girlfriend, Ashlen Diaz.

A snippet of the song originally surfaced online on March 12, 2019, and the full song leaked on March 14, 2019. After speculation by various media outlets, Post confirmed the track would be released on July 5, 2019, in a Twitter post.","[('Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)\n Turns out that it wasn’t what you wanted (Wanted)\n And we wouldn’t let go and we lost it\n Now I’m a goner', [['These lines may be directed toward Post Malone’s previous girlfriend, Ashlen Diaz. Their relationship appears to have ended as of 2018.\n\n\n\nNot much is known about their history as both have kept relatively quiet about it. Post commented on briefly on the situation in a 2016 interview with The Breakfast Club:\n\nIt’s been rocky sometimes, but you can imagine that with everything that’s going on […] It’s tough having a balance, between dedicating my life to music and dedicating time for Ashlen.']]), ('[Verse 3: Young Thug]', [['A snippet of “Goodbyes” leaked online on March 12, 2019, with the full track being leaked two days later on March 14. While the leaked version is very similar to the version that was officially released, the leaked version featured a few more bars from Thug:\n\nI just wanna see the side, the one that’s unbothered (Yeah)\nAnd I just wanna hit it one more time, yeah\nI don’t wanna damage your love, I ain’t tryna damage your love, woah\nAnd I don’t want ya to never go outside (Outside)\n\nIt’s currently unknown why these bars were stripped from the official version.\n\nThug also confirmed the lyrics to his verse in a post to his Instagram story on July 5, 2019.']]), ('Now I’m drinkin’ again, 80 proof in my veins', [['Proof is a term that goes back to 16th century England to measure the ethanol/alcohol in beverages. They would drop gun powder pellets in booze to see if it would burn or not. The booze was taxed higher based on the pellets burning or not burning.\n80 proof is basically 40% alcohol. The use of the measurement ‘proof’ today is mainly historical since we now use alcohol by volume (ABV).']]), ('You’re Barbie life doll, it’s Nicki Minaj', [['“Doll” is used as a term of endearment or as a description of a flawlessly attractive woman. Nicki Minaj has long referred to herself as “Barbie” (a literal doll), dating back to her debut mixtape Playtime is Over, released 12 years before “Goodbyes.” Nicki celebrated its anniversary on her Instagram during the same day.\n\n\n\nThe two have collaborated frequently in the past. Nicki remixed Young Thug’s “2 Bitches (Danny Glover)” in 2014. The two then collaborated indirectly on “Low” and “Throw Sum Mo” before directly collaborating on “Anybody.”']]), ('Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain', [[""Kurt Cobain was an American musician, best known as the lead singer for the rock band Nirvana. On March 3, 1994, the singer was hospitalized after ingesting too much champagne and Rohypnol. Some view this as Cobain’s first suicide attempt, but many did not have this impression when it originally happened. Kurt eventually died by suicide on April 5, 1994.\n\nPost uses this bar as a way to explain that even though popular musicians live exciting lives, there are also serious mental and emotional consequences that come along with it. He expressed similar views on his April 2018 track, “Rich & Sad”:\n\nAll this stuntin' couldn’t satisfy my soul (-oul)\nGot a hundred big places, but I’m still alone (–one)\n\nPost Malone is a big fan of Nirvana, and specifically Kurt Cobain, whose portrait he has tattooed on his left middle finger—his fingers are reserved for artists who heavily influenced his life. He has covered Nirvana’s classic December 1993 song, “All Apologies,” live during a concert and also has an unreleased song called “Kurt Cobain” with Rich the Kid.\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Bankroll Fresh, Dimebag Darrell, George Harrison, John Lennon, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Kurt Cobain, and Elvis Presley.""]])]","['', 'Hot ass beat clap', 'This official version cut out some key Thugger lyrics', 'wow this is fire from young jeffery and post!!!!!', 'Thugger bout to get anotha #1 dub!!!', 'YOUNG THUG CAN SING!!!

Mark Ronson later revealed the title in an interview with The Times magazine, complimenting Dua Lipa’s voice;

The drama has taken subject in numerous songs of Taylor’s, appearing all the way back on her sixth studio album, reputation. However, “long story short” offers a confirmation of resolution and peace, with Taylor finally feeling confident that that stage of her life has subsided.

“long story short” is a particular ode to Taylor’s current boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, who she began dating around the time of the drama. Chronicled in a handful of Taylor’s songs, “long story short” further emphasizes that Alwyn has always been her “safe place” throughout turmoil.","[('At the golden gates they once held the keys to', [['“They” seems to be the media and public, who contributed to Swift’s loss of control over her image after her spiral in 2016. She referenced this idea on her 2017 hit “Look What You Made Me Do”:\n\nI don’t like your kingdom keys\nThey once belonged to me\n\nDuring that line in the “LWYMMD” music video, Swift sat in a golden bird cage:\n\n\n\nA still from Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” music video.']]), ('Climbed right back up the cliff\n Long story short, I survived', [['As fans on Twitter noticed, this lyric mirrors one from Swift’s July 2020 track “hoax,” on which she sings:\n\nStood on the cliffside\nScreaming ‘give me a reason’']]), ('Evermore', [['A very obvious ode to the album’s title, evermore.\n\nThe previous track, “cowboy like me” includes the lyric:\n\nForever is the sweetest con\n\nHere, Taylor knowingly ignores the fact that “forever” doesn’t exist, and pledges her eternal love anyway. Combined, these two lyrics contribute to the album’s theme of speculation about the future (as referenced by the title), concluding that the inevitability of what is to come doesn’t matter anyway – that Taylor chooses to believe that her love will last forever, whatever the truth may be.']]), ('And he feels like home', [['The metaphor of her lover as her home– especially in terms of a physical location– is a favorite of Taylor’s. Think of the house as the representation of the relationship in the “Lover” music video, the symbolism of the apartment in “Cornelia Street,” or mourning the end of a relationship with “I’m not your homeland anymore” in “exile” and “I can go anywhere I want, just not home” in “my tears ricochet.” This line is perhaps the simplest iteration of that concept.']]), ('But if someone comes at us, this time, I’m ready', [['In the past, Taylor had talked about how most of her relationships died out after the media got ahold of it and ruined their connection by overexposure and denying them of privacy. In this lyric, Taylor makes a point to emphasise this relationship’s importance to her, learning from her past mistakes and being ready to defend herself this time. Her most known reference to her relationship with media effecting her personal life is in the song “I Know Places” in her 1989 album, the lyric follows as:\n\n“Something happens when everybody finds out\nSee the vultures circling, dark clouds\nLove’s a fragile little flame, it could burn out\nIt could burn out\n\n‘Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns\nThey are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run""\n\nHere however unlike I Know Places, she is facing her enemies and hunters.']]), ('I always felt I must look better in the rear view', [['This is the idea of constantly comparing the present to what was. What you had. What you were. That everything was easier because you were a better version of yourself last month, last year, last decade. Which would be difficult for someone like Taylor, who has been in the spotlight since 2006. Someone who has been seen so much musical and personal development in that time.']]), ('And I fell from the pedestal', [['Since this is a song about Taylor’s public demonization during the Reputation era, this line could very well suggest that she fell from the pedestal she was put on in the 1989 era. This could have been a result of the Kanye phone call ‘incident’.']]), ('I tried to pick my battles ’til the battle picked me', [['“Pick your battles” is a common idiom used to encourage a person to not concern themselves with petty conflicts or challenges they might not win. In this line, Taylor takes notice to the fact that, despite her best efforts to avoid drama, such drama always ends up finding and involving her.\n\nThis line is also an example of the literary device antimetabole, in which a phrase is repeated with the words reversed, in order to highlight the irony within the inversion.\n\nTaylor similarly sang about her battles picking her in 2017’s “End Game”:\n\nI swear I don’t love the drama, it loves me']]), ('When I dropped my sword\n I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door', [['These lyrics echo a sentiment from August 2019’s “Daylight,” which describes Swift’s hope for an everlasting relationship after years of heartbreak:\n\nThrew out our cloaks and our daggers\nBecause it’s morning now\nIt’s brighter now']]), ('Past me\n I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things\n Your nemeses\n Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing', [['Swift has experienced several public issues and feuds with other celebrities, most notably rapper Kanye West, fellow popstar Katy Perry, and mogul Scooter Braun.\n\nThough a teenage Swift forgave West for interrupting her speech at the 2009 Video Music Awards and wrote 2010’s “Innocent” as an ode to him, he and this then-wife Kim Kardashian fabricated a story about her approving vulgar lyrics to his 2016 track “Famous”:\n\nI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex\nWhy? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)\nI made that bitch famous\n\nKardashian posted illegally-recorded footage claiming that Swift approved the lyrics, but the “evidence” was edited and the full call leaked years later, proving Swift wasn’t aware of the “bitch” line. She wrote songs like 2017’s “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” about the ordeal.\n\nSwift’s conflict with Katy Perry started around 2013, when Perry allegedly “stole” dancers that Swift was planning on bringing on her Red Tour. Swift reportedly wrote 2014’s “Bad Blood” about the situation, and in 2016, Perry released a perfume called Mad Love that seemingly drew from a key “Bad Blood” lyric:\n\nBaby, now we got bad blood\nYou know, it used to be mad love\n\nBy 2019, the ladies reconnected, and Swift invited Perry to appear in her “You Need to Calm Down” music video. Swift even sent Perry and Orlando Bloom’s daughter a hand-embroidered blanket in September 2020.\n\nScooter Braun infamously bought the masters for Swift’s first six studio albums in June 2019, when she hadn’t gotten the opportunity to buy them herself. She began rerecording her albums to regain ownership of her work, starting with Fearless (Taylor’s Version) in April 2021.']])]","['i dont know why but i have a feeling this song is gonna give us last great american dynasty vibes', 'LONG STORY SHORT, IT WAS A BAD TIME\nLONG STORY SHORT, I SURVIVED!!!!!\nMASTERPIECE', 'Long story short this slaps', 'remember i knew you were trouble?\nthis is her now.\nfeel old yet?', 'i wanna fall in love so deep that this song is relatable', 'the getaway car, cruel summer, and august of this album', 'this is the getaway car to the cruel summer to the illicit affairs', 'i think this one is my favorite but i said that for like 5 songs', 'my poor wig', 'PLEASE THIS IS SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL', 'tom hiddleston has entered the chat…', 'SO MANY PEACE PARALLELS', 'it sounds like tlgad so much whatt', 'I feel like this is about 2016 Taylor', 'i claim this as the new anthem of my life', 'I am claiming this mine.', 'CERTIFIED BOP', 'is it referencing the hoax?', 'THIS ONE SLAPS', 'This gives me Getaway Car vibes']",2020-12-11,genius,taylor

I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)

And I couldn't be sure

Like “happiness,” “evermore” deals strongly with themes of mental health, though this track lays out a more linear path towards healing. Fittingly, Swift has publicly discussed her struggles with significant periods of depression in the past.","[('And I couldn’t be sure\n I had a feeling so peculiar\n This pain wouldn’t be for\n Evermore', [['This is a callback and reversal of the lines throughout the song. Taylor is recalling a difficult time through most of the song, most likely the summer of 2016, which she called an apocalypse.\n\n\n\nShe thought that the pain and suffering from that time period would never end. As the song goes on she describes the emotional turmoil she went through, and how one person, likely Joe, was the only one there for her. By the end she has realized that pain would not last forever, and she can finally heal.']]), ('I’m on waves, out being tossed', [['This references back to her earlier statement about being unmoored, but in a more intense and chaotic way that is in keeping with the music during the bridge versus in the earlier verses. The added drama in the metaphor reinforces the intensity of feeling the bridge creates.']]), ('I rewind the tape, but all it does is pause', [['Taylor has lived her life on screen for many years, making it easy for her to watch back public moments and see all the criticism surrounding her every move. In addition to this, she has also filmed a documentary (Miss Americana) which details some of the trials she has been through on her journey. The metaphor is her remembering all the moments in her life that have led to her feeling hopeless, and the fact that she can literally replay videos of her life only adds to the intensity.\n\nI think this line also refers to the idea that sometimes there are moments in life we want to rewind and figure out where we went wrong. “all it does is pause” reminds me of that feeling when you’ve lived through something traumatic (“very moment all was lost”) and you’re so heartbroken your memories become frozen and you can’t access them.

Here, Justin Vernon recasts this slow and lethargic time of year as violent. This contrast highlights the kind of emotional turmoil the first half of the song is about.\n\nTaken as a whole, the “dog days” lyric is the opposite side of “whether weather be the frost.” In other words, the weather may change, but the despair he’s singing about doesn’t.']]), ('To be certain, we’ll be tall again', [['Swift described a relationship as “tall” and strong on August 2019’s “Paper Rings”:\n\nHoney, without all the exes, fights, and flaws\nWe wouldn’t be standing here so tall']]), ('To be double-crossed', [['Like lyrics in the first verse, this could be a cursory reference to Taylor being “betrayed” by the leaking of edited footage in the Kanye West scandal.

She first used it on 2014’s “Welcome to New York,” the opener to 1989:\n\nIt’s a new soundtrack\nI could dance to this beat, beat, for evermore\nThe lights are so bright\nBut they never blind me, me\n\nShe notably used the phrase on 2017’s “New Years Day,” which is about her relationship with actor Joe Alwyn — Alwyn even co-wrote “evermore.”\n\nThere’s glitter on the floor after the party\nGirls carrying their shoes down in the lobby\nCandle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor\nYou and me for evermore']]), ('Floors of a cabin creaking under my step', [['Here Taylor wraps up the journey she quietly takes us on through this song. In the first chorus she stares out a window and in the second chorus she’s her “barefoot in the wildest winter” presumably outside where she was staring. Both choruses say “catching my death” and feel the pain would be for evermore. Taylor finds herself back in a cabin in the third chorus, finally safe again and feeling her pain won’t be evermore\n\nThis lyric also describes the imagery Taylor popularised during the folklore era with the cardigan music video.\n\n\n\nThis same cabin is also featured at the beginning and end of the music video for “willow,” proving that the cabin imagery has continued into the evermore era.\n\n“Wooden floors” remains a phrase sung quite often by Swift in fellow songs like gold rush\n\n“I see me padding across your wooden floors”\n\nand Cornelia Street:\n\n“Memorise the creaks in the floor”']]), ('[Bridge 2: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]', [['The first bridge expands the moment of ultimate dispair the character’s going through.\n\nBut the second part of bridge might be the most interesting, as it is the persona debating with theirselves.

While Justin’s stand for that part of our minds that tends to drags us back into our problems.\n\nThe bridge is familiar of Swift’s and Justin’s previous collabaration exile. Similarly the vocals sung over another repeating the verses is meant to be a simile of a couple talking about their now-ended relationship and looking back each from their own perspective.\n\nIt should be noted that both songs exile and evermore were co-written by Swift’s boyfriend actor and songwriter Joe Alwyn.']])]","['the beat change at Justin’s part ? amazing ! and how it becomes slow again after ? genius', 'Exile or Evermore…', 'Evermore = Exile 2.0', 'Taylor is the artist of century ❤️', 'this pain won’t be for evermore, but my love for her… oh yeah, forever&always', 'TAYLOR SWIFT THE ARTIST OF OUR GENERATION!!!!\nWHAT AN ALBUM, SHE DELIVERED YET AGAIN!!!!', 'TS9…WOOOO…2020 IS SAVED…AGAIN', 'their voices are meant to be together like WOW', 'the way the piano changes during justin’s part…. ahhhhhhh !!!!!!', 'this was an amazing experience – thank you ms. swift', 'ugh, I don’t know which I like more!

Ah, ah101EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Grammys-2021-nominees-annotated,5793983,Taylor Swift,"“exile” describes two ex-lovers seeing each other following a break-up. Justin Vernon describes feelings of confusion about how quickly a lover moved on, while Swift offers a perspective about repeated warning signs that the relationship was no longer working. It’s also worth noting the contrast between Vernon’s rougher voice and Swift’s smoother one, which mirrors the contrast between their views of the relationship.

The song prompted many comparisons to Swift’s 2012 track “The Last Time,” another song that discusses the downfall of a relationship. Much like “exile,” Swift and featured artist Gary Lightbody’s voices contrast in tone, highlighting their differences.

“exile” is one of many folklore songs to contain a movie motif — other songs to do so include “the 1,” “this is me trying,” and “hoax.” It’s also her first collaboration with Bon Iver, who she called one of her “musical heroes” in an Instagram post announcing folklore.","[('Like you’d get your knuckles bloody for me', [['Her ex is staring threateningly at her new partner, but she knows he would never actually fight for her. It’s a play on fighting for her; in this line, she means a physical altercation with her new partner. Whereas throughout the song she reiterates that he never really tried to keep their relationship from falling apart, metaphorically not fighting for her/them.']]), ('[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]', [['Throughout the verses of “exile,” Vernon and Swift give their own perspectives on why the relationship failed. Within the bridge, their two narratives compete, with their voices layering and interrupting each other. This production choice mirrors the cyclical nature of the couple’s past arguments, in which neither felt heard.\n\nSwift explained in a promotional clip she sent to radio stations:\n\n‘exile’ is a song that was written about miscommunications in relationships, and in the case of this song, I imagined that the miscommunications ended the relationship. […] We imagined the beginning would be his side of the story, the second verse her side of the story, and the end would be the story of them talking over each other and not hearing each other.\n\nProducer Aaron Dessner also shared in folklore: the long pond studio sessions:\n\nWhen we talked about it, I was like ‘I think he’s gonna be really inspired by this’ and then, when we sent it to him, he was. Then, the process of working on it and what he sent it back, we didn’t ask him to write anything, but he wrote this amazing bridge.']]), ('You never gave a warning sign', [['Interestingly, the song concludes with Justin Vernon getting the last word. Throughout the song, Swift is the one who seems to be more proactive towards the relationship’s end, choosing to leave “out the side door” to prevent more arguments and finding a new lover to move on. She abandons the lyrical argument in the same way she left the relationship.']]), ('I’m not your problem anymore', [['This lyric contrasts a lyric in the previous chorus — Vernon’s character sees Swift’s character as his “homeland” he swore to defend, while she assumes he simply saw her as a “problem” he needed to deal with.\n\nYou’re not my homeland anymore\n\nThe jealousy Swift describes in her verse suggests that Vernon’s character may still have feelings for her, though she may not realize it. As a result, she doesn’t understand how he could possibly be jealous after his obligation has ended. This is one of the ways in which the theme of miscommunication develops over the course of the song before culminating in the back-and-forth bridge.']]), ('And it took you five whole minutes\n To pack us up and leave me with it\n Holdin’ all this love out here in the hall', [['“Exile” is used as a metaphor for being on the outside of a relationship that once was. The opening verse broadens this metaphor slightly, to encompass the experience of moving out after a breakup. Rather than packing suitcases, he had to pack up his feelings for the other narrator.']]), ('You’re not my homeland anymore\n So what am I defending now?', [['Swift previously described her relationship with Joe Alwyn as “home” on her August 2019 track “It’s Nice to Have a Friend,” and it comes up again on December 2020’s “long story short”:\n\nAnd he’s passing by\nRare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky\nAnd he feels like home\n\nThe notion of defending one’s homeland as a metaphor for fighting for love also ties into the running thread of war and battle imagery on folklore — notable examples include “epiphany” and “peace,” on which she sings:\n\nYou know that I’d swing with you for the fences\nSit with you in the trenches']]), ('You were my crown, now I’m in exile, seein’ you out', [['Justin Vernon’s chorus refers to his subject as “my town,” while Swift’s chorus refers to her subject as “my crown.” This represents the patriarchal power dynamic of their relationship that Swift escapes out the side door. A king, for example (e.g. “the crown”), rules over his town. The town is ruled by the crown.\n\nThe term “crown” can also be used to talk about a monarchical country, like Britain. In this way, it could actually be a parallel statement to the earlier refrain, “you were my hometown”.\n\nAs this line relates back to the song title – exile – it also represents how although Swift may have been the one to leave the relationship, she feels exiled (e.g. punished, barred from one’s home) as much as he does. An exile implies being forced to leave town, often unwillingly and punitively. Even though Swift voluntarily left the relationship, she feels forced out by her partner’s inability to read her signs.']]), ('So who am I offending now?', [['Earlier, Bon Iver sings ‘So what am I defending now?’. This change of lyrics in the chorus conveys the difference between the two personas, as one still feels like they are guarding their past lover whereas the other is portrayed as attacking them.\n\nPROPOSED SUGGESTION: Romantic relationship is usually used as a form to fix someone’s problems in midia. In this line, she’s nodding to past relationships where the partner made her feel guilt about her mistakes, as if they were his responsability.']]), ('Like he’s just your understudy', [['In theatre terminology, an “understudy” is the actor who learns to play the part of another so they can replace the original actor at a moment’s notice if needed.\n\nIn this context, Swift’s former lover looks at her current lover as if he’s nothing more than a temporary and subpar replacement for himself. This line deepens the imagery of their love being pre-scripted, with the film having already played out before.']]), ('We always walked a very thin line', [['Swift included a similar description of a relationship’s fragility on October 2010’s “Haunted,” another song that describes desperation and anxiety about a crumbling relationship:\n\nYou and I walk a fragile line\nI had known it all this time\nBut I never thought I’d live to see it break']])]","['what a sad breakup song 😢 they know their relationship would end from the very start but at least they have tried….

It’s a stark turn from her sixth studio album, reputation, released in 2017, which is known for its dark visuals and mature themes.

After a YouTube credits leak the day before its release, the collaboration was confirmed by Swift herself when she appeared with Robin Roberts on ABC. Before Swift went on air, a Spotify billboard in London, England began to promote the track.

The music video for the song gained 65.2 million views on YouTube in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest 24-hour debut for a female or solo artist on the platform, as well as breaking the record for the biggest 24-hour VEVO debut, which she previously achieved with “Look What You Made Me Do.” It also broke the record for most first-day plays on US pop radio, another record previously held by “LWYMMD.”

In April 2019, just weeks before this song’s release, Swift donated $113,000 to a project that helps combat anti-LGBT laws in Tennessee.

If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Disappointments, close your eyes

And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

In the tree line
By the gold clock

Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away

The sight that flashed before me was your face

Like much of The National’s extensive catalogue, the track is subdued and melancholic sonically. Through the use of back-and-forth conversational lyrics littered with imagery that is rich with bygone experiences, it evokes a heavy feeling of loss and nostalgia for a past relationship where effort was not equal from both sides.

The lyrics contrast with the title location itself–Coney Island–a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York that is famous as a tourist destination for its lively carnival park setting. Additionally, the community district is Brooklyn 13, a number that is particularly special to Swift.","[('Sorry for not making you my centerfold', [['A centerfold is the page that a magazine most readily and naturally opens up to.

Individual locations of chain restaurants, like McDonald’s, are called franchises. Travis reunites with his friend and frequent collaborator, Young Thug; they are joined by British musician, M.I.A.

“FRANCHISE” pays homage to Dem Franchize Boyz and their 2004 single, “White Tee.” Travis Scott and CHASE B first previewed this single as “White Tee” during the tenth episode of .WAV RADIO on July 20, 2020. It was subtly teased again in the commercial for Travis’ McDonald’s meal on September 8, 2020.

The final Travis Scott and McDonald’s merchandise collaboration released on September 16, 2020, and Travis revealed that there was a secret included in it. This secret was the official pre-order for the single’s imminent release. Five days later, on the 21st, Travis officially confirmed the song’s artwork and release date.

The official music video was premiered alongside the single on September 25. Parts of the video were filmed at Michael Jordan’s Illinois mansion. A lyric video and visualizer were also released.","[('[Verse 3: M.I.A., Travis Scott & Sheck Wes]', [['M.I.A.’s vocals were taken from her solo demo of the song, which was chopped up & cut down into a verse and an outro.']]), ('Popped ‘em in his hands, he was typin’ (Da, da, da)', [[""Reminiscent of A$AP Ferg’s “Plain Jane”\n\nGrandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!\nShe was poppin' pills like rappers in society\n\nThug details someone suffering from Carpel Tunnel Syndrome from repeated typing on a keyboard, needing to take painkillers to ease the symptoms.

However Young Thug is so succesful that contrary to what Pusha T said, he did not need to make such deals to make 20 million and thus can metaphorically afford to offer the devil’s luck back at it as a tip as if saying ‘keep the change’.']]), ('London city, left the town (Ah)', [['M.I.A lived much of her early life in Hounslow which whilst part of Greater London is technically a suburban town.

The track is a standout on his recent album Melly vs. Melvin, which was released in November 2019.

It follows them as they go through their relationship and as they reminisce about their memories together.

The song marks the debut of the multi-award winning songwriter, producer and musician Benny Blanco, featuring Khalid and Halsey. Its release was first hinted at by some of his fans on Twitter, just days before its release. Benny Blanco himself then confirmed the song through Twitter on 11 July 2018:
https://twitter.com/ItsBennyBlanco/status/1016748701572714497","[('In the city where the sun don’t set', [['Wordplay is used here. The east is where the sun rises from, but you can, of course, see the sunset on the West of the Eastside. It shows the correlation they tried to convey between the East on a map and the Eastside of their city.\n\nAlthough Khalid was born in Fort Stewart, Georgia he identifies himself as being from El Paso, Texas. This is likely to be a reference to El Paso since the city’s nickname is ‘Sun City’ due to its hot/dry climate and its beautiful sunsets.\n\nAn additional meaning is Khalid alluding to New York City, as New York is commonly known as “the city that never sleeps”. In fact, Halsey’s old stomping grounds were New York City, and the East Side is every Manhattan neighborhood bordering the East Rivery. Perhaps the sun doesn’t set due to the skyscrapers surrounding the narrator’s field of view, and the neon lights that light up the city, even at night.\n\nLastly, in a metaphorical sense, the fact that the “sun doesn’t set” symbolizes the hope and optimism of this happy time in their relationship. The day feels like it will never end, just like happiness of their relationship.']])]","['Halsey breaking hearts with a BOP!!! 🔥🔥🔥', 'What a collaboration.', 'This will be 2018’s top summer song, save my words', 'The collab we didn’t know he needed.

This was followed on November 21st, 2019 by a new, higher budget video via Vevo, directed by Adam Powell.

The song is blackbear’s spin on the #hotgirlsummer trend. Megan Thee Stallion fans, who originated the trend, inspiring the song “Hot Girl Summer” reacted negatively to the song, claiming that blackbear appropriated the idea. blackbear, however, claimed the song “has to do [with] the caption trend” and doesn’t parody the song. In fact, he teased the song and title during July 2019, before the release of Megan’s “Hot Girl Summer” on August 9th, 2019.

On the cover art of this playful, energetic track, Maddy Crum, who was previously featured in Aidan Cullen-directed short film, THE ANONYMOUS SAGA, is pictured with a face covered in colorful stickers and a nosebleed. She shared an Instagram story wearing merchandise and another using the official Snapchat filter designed by Harley Wrecks to mimic the cover a few hours before release.

In the song, Tyler’s thoughts are presumed to be shared with his wife Jenna as he also asks them for comfort, even if it is a lie.

Inspired to write a song during the pandemic to help the workers in the live music industry, Tyler decided to make his first attempt at writing on an electric guitar. A portion of the single’s proceeds were donated to Crew Nation, an organization that helps individuals who work in the live performance industry who were laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The song’s music video shows Tyler and Josh quarantined in their homes with their families, with Tyler’s then-newborn daughter Rosie appearing in the band’s media for the first time. Tyler and Josh collaborate on the song and video by mailing the USB drive from the single art back and forth to each other.","[('Things are starting to get heavy, mm\n I can’t help but think I haven’t felt this way\n Since I asked you to go steady', [['KISS 107.1 Cincinnati tweeted some of the song’s deeper backstory, revealing that much of the song is inspired by Tyler’s relationship with his wife, Jenna, with whom he had just celebrated their five-year wedding anniversary. The radio station shared:\n\nTyler’s mom inspired him to write a song for their fans in this unprecedented moment in all of our lives. He decided to write about the last time he felt this out of control. This virus has taken such a huge toll on everyone and as a new dad now in lockdown it makes him feel helpless. He chose to turn it into a love song about his wife. He compares this time of little control to that moment when he decided to commit to a life with Jenna & that uneasy feeling of realizing that when you make that kind of a commitment to someone else, you give up a good portion of control. Its no longer all about you, its about us!\n\nThroughout the song, Tyler compares the commitment of a relationship to being in a quarantine together and a “bunker underneath the surface.”']]), ('Panic on the brain, Michael’s gone insane\n Julie starts to make me nervous', [[""In an Facebook Live interview with 101WKQX, Tyler shared that he is not calling out a Michael and Julie that he knows, saying:\n\nI guess when I was writing that song I loved the idea of just name dropping two random people because I feel like everyone has a Michael and a Julie in their life that are either thinking they’re experts on what’s going on in the world or experts on your personal relationship. I personally have a friend named Michael but I don’t think I was thinking of him particularly as much as I was just picking two names that I felt applied to what most people would think as annoying people.\n\nThe “Michael” Tyler is talking about is the same one fans assumed he was originally calling out. This is Michael Gibson, who was twenty one pilots' tour manager for five years and ended his career with the band in August 2016, just after Blurryface received it 2x multi-platinum certification by the RIAA.

It was a dream project of Tyler’s to have his own dedicated space to tinker and write like that, creating a sort of mini-home for him inside his house.
