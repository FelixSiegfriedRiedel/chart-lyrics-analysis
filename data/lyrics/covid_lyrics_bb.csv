In the song, Tyler’s thoughts are presumed to be shared with his wife Jenna as he also asks them for comfort, even if it is a lie.

Inspired to write a song during the pandemic to help the workers in the live music industry, Tyler decided to make his first attempt at writing on an electric guitar. A portion of the single’s proceeds were donated to Crew Nation, an organization that helps individuals who work in the live performance industry who were laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The song’s music video shows Tyler and Josh quarantined in their homes with their families, with Tyler’s then-newborn daughter Rosie appearing in the band’s media for the first time. Tyler and Josh collaborate on the song and video by mailing the USB drive from the single art back and forth to each other.","[('Things are starting to get heavy, mm\n I can’t help but think I haven’t felt this way\n Since I asked you to go steady', [['KISS 107.1 Cincinnati tweeted some of the song’s deeper backstory, revealing that much of the song is inspired by Tyler’s relationship with his wife, Jenna, with whom he had just celebrated their five-year wedding anniversary. The radio station shared:\n\nTyler’s mom inspired him to write a song for their fans in this unprecedented moment in all of our lives. He decided to write about the last time he felt this out of control. This virus has taken such a huge toll on everyone and as a new dad now in lockdown it makes him feel helpless. He chose to turn it into a love song about his wife. He compares this time of little control to that moment when he decided to commit to a life with Jenna & that uneasy feeling of realizing that when you make that kind of a commitment to someone else, you give up a good portion of control. Its no longer all about you, its about us!\n\nThroughout the song, Tyler compares the commitment of a relationship to being in a quarantine together and a “bunker underneath the surface.”']]), ('Panic on the brain, Michael’s gone insane\n Julie starts to make me nervous', [[""In an Facebook Live interview with 101WKQX, Tyler shared that he is not calling out a Michael and Julie that he knows, saying:\n\nI guess when I was writing that song I loved the idea of just name dropping two random people because I feel like everyone has a Michael and a Julie in their life that are either thinking they’re experts on what’s going on in the world or experts on your personal relationship. I personally have a friend named Michael but I don’t think I was thinking of him particularly as much as I was just picking two names that I felt applied to what most people would think as annoying people.\n\nThe “Michael” Tyler is talking about is the same one fans assumed he was originally calling out. This is Michael Gibson, who was twenty one pilots' tour manager for five years and ended his career with the band in August 2016, just after Blurryface received it 2x multi-platinum certification by the RIAA. Michael made a fake reaction to the supposed namedrop in an IGTV reaction video as well as a an Instagram post calling Tyler insane.""]]), ('Need you, tell me\n Need you, tell me', [[""Often during times of crises, people lie that things are going to get better when they don’t actually think they will. They just say they will to comfort those around them.\n\nTyler is presumably asking for comfort from his wife Jenna throughout the song, a theme that was introduced in “Tear in My Heart” and returned in “Smithereens.”\n\nBut if I’m feelin'\nSomeone stepping towards you, can’t describe\nJust what I’m feelin'\n…\nAnd you know\nI got your six…\n\nThis shows their working marriage relationship in that they both support and help each other. Jenna often posts about the two of them on Instagram. When their daughter Rosie was born, she wrote to Tyler in a post saying:\n\n\ntyler,\n\nyou’re a thinker, you’re a trooper, you’re a fixer, you’re a looker still at 6am with no sleep. you work so hard. you are the most diligent and supportive person, I’m lucky you’re my person. Rosie and I love you.""]]), ('I don’t really care what they would say\n I’m asking you to stay\n In my bunker underneath the surface', [['With the coronavirus came stay-at-home orders from each state to their residents. However, many people objected to this order due to their desire to remain in contact with other people. While this increased their risks for the coronavirus and being arrested, they saw it as a necessary risk in order to spend time with other people.\n\nThe bunker Tyler is referring to is most likely his studio space of a basement. It was a dream project of Tyler’s to have his own dedicated space to tinker and write like that, creating a sort of mini-home for him inside his house. The basement was introduced during the leak of “My Blood”. After Warner decided to release the song early due to its virality on YouTube, they allowed Tyler to upload a now-unlisted video with him playing alongside the studio recording in his new space.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BnAJCv7Aibu/\n\nThis may also be a reference to the time Tyler asked God to stay and support him in “The Run and Go:”\n\nDon’t wanna give you all my demons\nYou’ll have to watch me struggle\nFrom several rooms away\nBut tonight I’ll need you to stay\n\nWhile still longing for support, Tyler receives it this time from his family in “Level of Concern.”']]), ('’Cause I told you my level of concern\n But you walked by like you never heard', [['Many people grew more concerned about the coronavirus as time went on and it spread. This lead to stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines. However, several people ignored these regulations due to their low level of concern both for themselves and those around them.\n\nInitial reports claimed the disease was most intense with infants and elderly people due to the susceptible state of their immune systems. However, that claim has since been denied but still frightens many parents with younger children. The recent birth of his daughter, Rosie Robert Joseph, may have caused Tyler’s level of concern for her well being to rise.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B82Ctp5ArwE/']]), ('Panic on the brain, world has gone insane', [['This song was released during the coronavirus panic so many of the track’s lyrics mirror what was happening in the world at the time. “World has gone insane” likely references the fact that the World Health Organization had recently declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. “Panic on the brain” most likely refers to the state of panic that numerous people went to, many of them buying stores out of supplies like toilet paper.\n\nCOVID-19, or the coronavirus, is an infectious disease that causes respiratory illness symptoms that are similar to pneumonia. Those suffering from it often experience a cough, fever, or in more serious cases, difficulty breathing. Many citizens all around the world were being encouraged to quarantine themselves in their houses in an attempt to help slow the spread of COVID-19, and with the United States issuing state-wide stay-at-home orders.\n\n\n\nThe music video for this song shows band members Tyler and Josh quarantined in their houses with their families, pushing the idea that they love spending time with their families despite the social distancing guidelines.\n\nThis line could also a pun on the phrase “Would you be my Valentine?”']])]","['', 'WHO IS MICHAEL AND JULIE', 'https://giphy.com/gifs/excited-seinfeld-12UlfHpF05ielO', 'THIS JUST MADE MY QUARANTINE X1000 BETTER', 'YEEEEE I AM SO HYPED', 'HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SLEEP?', 'Finally new TØP!!!!!', 'idk if i’ll be able to handle this', 'It’s impossible for me to dislike a song by them, like, I.

DaBaby says he ‘Woo’s’ which is a signature of Pop Smoke as he opens up most of the song with the ‘Woo’ sound. Pop Smoke was also in a New York gang alliancecalled ‘The Woo’s’, had a mixtape series called Meet The Woo and later a posthumous record of his was released called The Woo.\n\nDaBaby collaborated with Pop Smoke after his death on a posthumous track called For The Night alongside Lil Baby.']]), ('I heard they shut down the airport\n Hopped on a jet to LA, bitch, I’m ballin’ like Bron-Bron', [['Due to the global coronavirus pandemic in 2020, numerous nations imposed travel restrictions to contain the spread of the virus.

This song I've been writing, oh, for a few months
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)

Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
You got some liquor at the house?
Yeah
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
I don't see it
Okay, hahaha

Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
Yes, sir
(Baby)
Hold on, hold on
(Let me tell you something about me)
(I really do know, I know who I wanna be)
Woo
Lord, I already passed on all that (Woo)

I’m not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

The intro, interlude, and outro on the track are taken from Drake’s Instagram Live session with his father, Dennis Graham, that occurred on March 21, 2020, amidst the outbreak of COVID-19 and international quarantine efforts used to deter its spread.","[('Like I’m tryna show the waves, this is no cap', [['Drake alludes to not wearing a cap to show off his waves, as a play on words to show that he is not lying – as the phrase ‘no cap’ suggests']]), ('Spoiled rotten, they could smell you ’fore you walked in', [['There is a double meaning here – one of a positive connotation and one of a negative connotation.\n\nThe negative one, which is what is more associate with the phrase “spoiled rotten” is that she has a bad entitled attitude and everyone knows her by it when she walks in.\n\nThe positive connotation, which is less easily detectable, is that Drake has spoiled her with wealth, gifts and fame, that people also know her as a result of that. They can even smell the expensive signature fragrances that she wears and know that it is her before she enters a room.']]), ('I had friends that only had half of they heart in', [['Firstly, it could mean that these people were not fully engaged or committed to the friendship and had ulterior motives.\n\nSecondly, when one is said to not have a heart, among many things, it means they are horrible people. Having half a heart would just be a step below that.']]), ('This life is really something you get lost in', [['As a huge A-list celebrity, Drake lives larger than life and it is easy for someone who is not used to it like the girl he speaks about to get lost in. She gets lost in the fame, the expensive gifts, popularity etc. At the same time, she’s too focused on it that she has lost herself and as a result Drake has lost her.']]), ('When I visit my last place is the only time I’m in last place\n See me these days, I never got on a sad face', [['Drake puts a twist on a line from Mike Stud’s July 2015 song, “These Days”:\n\nOnly time I’m second place is when I’m at my second place']]), ('Like I’m tryna show the waves, this is no cap', [['Drake uses this line as a double entendre explaining that he enjoys showing off his waves instead of keeping a wave-cap on to keep them fresh.\n\n\n\nAn infamous selfie of Drake in a wave-cap (a.k.a. a “du-rag”)\n\nThe term “no cap” simply means someone isn’t lying. Drake then uses the line to say that he is making waves in music and that he isn’t lying about it.\n\nAn example of his trendiness in music is his song “Toosie Slide” that created a dance craze on TikTok, even before the song had released.']]), ('This is not one of them stories that got three sides\n This is not one of them stories you could rewind', [['Drake could be dropping a nod to two storytelling songs—Joe Budden’s December 2005 song, “Three Sides To A Story” and Nas‘ December 2001 song, “Rewind.”\n\nNas listed Drake as one of his top five current rappers in 2016 while Budden and Drake have had a long history of feuding before squashing their beef on Budden’s Instagram Live in April 2020.']]), ('I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting\n I couldn’t sit around and wait, I had to have it happen', [['Before finding fame as a rapper, Drake acted in the  Canadian television show, Degrassi: The Next Generation where he played Jimmy Brooks, a high school basketball star who’s wheelchair-bound after he was shot by another student. This ties in with the “couldn’t sit around” line.\n\n\n\nIn a 2013 interview with CBC News, Drake spoke about how he doesn’t have to put on a persona, splitting between his public and private life. He said:\n\nI get to wake up every day, and I don’t have to think about anything, I just get to go and be myself. I don’t have to remember to do this, or dress like this, or put on this accent. I just get to wake up and be myself.\n\nIn the same interview, when asked about why he chose a career in music over acting he said:\n\nI knew right away, and it had a lot to do with the process of acting. It’s just so dependent on so many other things other than yourself.

And the crickets hum their tune
That's usually about the time
That I feel most alive
But the news has all been bad
And the whole world seems so sad
I ain't had much else going on
So I sat down and wrote this song

I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
It's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

I miss my mom, I miss my dad
I miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

Some day when we aren't six feet apart",https://genius.com/Luke-combs-six-feet-apart-lyrics,1362,278,en,0.9999966980738384,2020-05-16,Luke Combs,"During the difficult and unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, “Six Feet Apart,” is a hopeful, yet sad, song by American country music star Luke Combs.

Luke briefly explained the song’s meaning in the song’s YouTube video bio:

It’s about the current times and us looking forward to the day all of this is over. I hope y'all like it.","[('Probably over-wash my hands', [['I just wanted to add a little bit of like lightheartedness in there, man. Eventually this thing is going to end and we know it’s not going to be tomorrow, but it’s going to end sooner than later. And I think that’ll be something we can laugh about later.']]), ('Watch a ball game from the stands', [['I’m a huge Carolina Panthers guy. Would definitely love to go see them. I went to Appalachia State.  I think people will be going out and having experiences more after this. Because they’ll realize that it’s not something that’s guaranteed, you know? It’s a privilege to be able to go sit in a sporting arena and watch a NBA game or watch a college basketball game, you know? That’s something that we get to do. And I think now, we’re all kind of realizing that it was never something that we were guaranteed.']]), ('Buy my buddies all a round\n Pay some extra on the tab\n Catch a movie, catch a cab', [['At times it can be tough for me to really go do anything. Which is a good thing; I’m definitely not complaining about that. Because that means things are going well. But my life has just changed in a lot of ways since this all started. So I think it’s more like, the pay the extra on the tab thing was, obviously there are a lot of people in the restaurant world who are struggling right now, you know? And you know, I’m a big guy; I like to eat. So I got a lot of respect for those folks that cook some dinner for us and serve for us. So I just feel really lucky to be able to do what I do. I’ve been really blessed financially. And I’m a big believer in giving that back in any way that I can, you know? Even if it’s tipping somebody $100 on a $20 check, you know? I enjoy being able to do that and helping somebody who might need it. You know, they might not need it. I don’t know. But it just always feels like the right thing to do. And I think, after this is all over, that will be something that people should probably do a little bit more of, you know what I mean? Is put an extra five bucks on there if you can. That may help somebody out a lot more than you realize. So that’s kind of where that whole idea for that specific line came from was just being able to give back in any way that you can.']]), ('First thing that I’m gonna do\n Slide on in some corner booth\n And take the whole damn family out', [['I would think the first thing I would want to do would be play a show. I would really love to do that, because we were about to play a show, and about to do arenas in Dublin, London, and in Glasgow, which would have been really cool. So obviously missed out on that opportunity, but that would be it. But I think it would be really neat to just go to a bar and have a beer too. I know there are some places in the country that are opened up, but I’m the guy that errs on the side of caution when it comes to that kind of stuff. So being able to do that when it really feels normal again, when it’s just a carefree thing, I think would be interesting. Because I could probably pop down the street and get a beer at a bar right now if I wanted to, but that just doesn’t seem like the right thing to do to me right now. So I think doing that when you don’t have to worry about it is going to be really nice.']]), ('It’s a mystery, I suppose\n Just how long this thing goes\n But there’ll be crowds and there’ll be shows\n And there will be light after dark\n Some day when we aren’t six feet apart', [['I’m definitely hopeful, but I feel like there’s nothing else I can do to physically change anything. I’m not a trained medical professional, so I can’t go out and help people in that sense. I’ve donated some money to some various causes, which has been a great thing. But I think just being hopeful is all I really have right now, you know what I mean? I mean, obviously you got your friends and family, and your loved ones, and stuff, to hold on to in these times.But I don’t know, I don’t think anybody knows. It’s a wait-and-see environment. And doing what musicians do, I think that’s going to be one of the last things that opens back up. It’s not going to be like tomorrow, they’re going to be like, “Man virus is down 1%, so let’s have a show with 20,000 people.” So in that sense it can be defeating, but it’s also you know that eventually it will happen. It might be two months from now, it may be a lot longer than that, so we’ll see.']]), ('Miss the road, I miss my band\n Giving hugs and shaking hands', [['I mean, really just miss the fans more than anything. Being able to play music in front of people is really neat, so not being able to do that, and not knowing when that will ever happen for me again. It’s definitely not going to be soon, I don’t think. And so, that’s a pretty defeating feeling, you know what I mean? You just know, and that you have this ability and this platform to go out and do something that you super happy. And something that makes a lot of other people super happy, and enjoy their night, or their week, or whatever it is. That’s a really great feeling, and not getting to do that is tough because you don’t write songs for yourself to sit around and listen to. I enjoy writing songs and I enjoy singing, but I do it for other people.']]), ('I miss my mom, I miss my dad', [['I miss a lot of stuff about my parents. I miss seeing them. I miss getting to have really cool experiences with them. They’ve both recently retired in the last couple of years, and so we’ve gotten to do a lot of really cool stuff together. I’m an only child, so my relationship with my parents is a little bit extra strong, I would say. They don’t live that far from me. They live about five hours from here. It’s enough where they can drive and come and hang out whenever they want to. I think them not being able to do that has been really tough on them and tough on me, so I’m looking forward to that happening.']]), ('But the news has all been bad\n And the whole world seems so sad', [['I don’t think there was really any hidden meaning there in that line. I was in Europe when all this news started popping off for lack of a better term. We had to turn around in 24 hours and come home. Everybody was glued to their televisions for the first two weeks of this thing. There was no good news. There was no like, “Oh, a teacher helped their student do this or do that.” It was just all bad all the time, and it still is. You can definitely do too much of that. It’s obviously great to be informed and know what’s going on with this thing. That’s obviously one of the most important things that you can do is be informed on it. After a while, you can’t live in that reality either. You have to go, “I need to stay home and be safe, but I need to get out of that negative headspace.” That’s just the way I was feeling. It was bogging me down, and just hearing that every day and not knowing, when are we going to get to play shows again? Or when are we going to get to do this again? Once you realize it can’t stop you from writing songs or making music or singing or doing things that you enjoy doing alone, as alone as you can possibly be. You just have to keep going.']]), ('When the dogwoods start to bloom\n And the crickets hum their tune\n That’s usually about the time\n That I feel most alive', [['I’ve been turkey hunting a lot, it’s Turkey season right now in early spring. That was the easiest way to sum up the feeling of being outside. It’s finally starting to warm up a little bit and you have an opportunity to be outdoors a little bit more. I think that was the thought behind that line. It doesn’t feel any different outside. The world doesn’t feel any different when you’re out in the woods or something like that. I think that’s it. There’s really a lot of opportunities for life to be the same, at least here. We don’t live in downtown Nashville, so we’ve got a little bit of land that we can go out and have some space to roam and walk around the woods and stuff. It’s been positive in that sense. It hasn’t changed too much other than all of a sudden you’re like, “Man, I need to go get this thing from the store or whatever.” Then when you go in town, you realize how weird everything is.']])]","['BANGER', ':(', '<3', ""F**kin' Aye…what a wicked wicked great song Luke."", 'Goated', 'amazing song luke combs one of my favorite', 'I love you Luke, it’s your fan From South Africa, I already miss my Mom already..

Hit the bitch for a rack, then ignore her
I'm so sick of these rats and these whores
I might marry my girl and just go away
Eat her out if she rich, got expensive taste

On the track, Lil Baby uses the current social distancing recommendation – due to the COVID-19 pandemic – as a metaphor to emphasize how far ahead of the competition he is.

The track comes just weeks after his April 2020 compassionate early release due to the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in America.

On the track, 6ix9ine addresses many of the people who negatively commented on how he dealt with his charges in the aforementioned court case and his early release.

Rumors of the track first began on April 29, 2020 when it was confirmed that Tekashi sought and received permission from federal judges to shoot a music video in the backyard of his residence. On May 7, 2020, billboards in Times Square confirmed the release of an upcoming single the next day, which ended up being “GOOBA.”

The song broke the record of most viewed hip-hop video within 24 hours, which was previously set by Eminem.","[('Now we catch him at the chicken spot, up a couple chops', [[""Chicken spot, according to Urban Dictionary, is usually a slang term used by people to refer to any chicken restaurant that isn’t a KFC franchise, however it could also be a reference to The Chicken Spot, a restaurant that was created by Chris Veso, the CEO of Queens Hospitality, that has its headquarters in Queens, New York, which is also the birthplace of 6ix9ine.\n\n‘'Chop’‘ is a slang term for talk.""]]), ('Dímelo, mami\n Fresca, you nasty', [['“Dímelo” translates to “tell it to me,” while “mami,” literally meaning “little mama,” is an affectionate term for a female partner like “baby girl” in English.\n\n“Fresca,” sometimes pronounced “freca,” is a term in Spanish that can literally be translated as “fresh,” but is often used in a sexual context, describing a woman who will easily have sex, and can be used as a pejorative like “slut” in English.']]), ('Niggas always wanna chase clout, bitch, I am clout', [['6ix9ine defines himself as clout incarnate, and not for nothing either: shortly after the release of “GOOBA”, he started an Instagram Live video which quickly garnered an audience of over 2,000,000 viewers, breaking the record for most Instagram Live viewers at a time, which had previously been held by Bad Bunny, with 350,000 viewers. He boasted about the feat on Twitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/6ix9ine/status/1258851646794166272\n\nVarious outlets and fellow artists, including Blueface and Meek Mill, have described his antics as “clout chasing” behavior.\n\nThe reasons for his clout are varied, but it’s undeniable that 6ix9ine has steadily remained in the headlines and in people’s mouths since his debut, for better or for worse.

In particular, about keeping some trysts secret and women who are shy but nevertheless freaky in bed.

The track samples The Showboys‘ ever-popular January 1986 single, “Drag Rap (Triggerman),” which Chris previously sampled on June 2019’s “Emerald / Burgundy.”

Executive producer HoodyBaby shared a snippet of “Go Crazy” in a now-deleted Instagram on April 30.","[('Black and gray diamonds like a Raider (Raider)', [['This could be a reference to the professional American football team known as the Las Vegas\nRaiders, whose logo contains both of the aforementioned colors.']]), ('(Oh, is that Kaniel again?)', [['This is the producer tag for KanielTheOne.

Kelly’s track Bump n' Grind (Old School Remix) at around ~ 1:55 into the song. Juvenile also sampled this section in his 2006 song “Rodeo”. Chris could have drawn inspiration from either or both of these previous hits. But it seems more likely that he was inspired by R. Kelly due to their past collaborations, performances, and Chris’ nods to him throughout his music.""]]), ('I been overseas goin’ crazy (Yeah)', [[""As Thugger has gradually become a more popular artist, he has taken his performances international.

They also drop bars on the COVID-19 pandemic, an ongoing disease at the time of this song’s release, to compare their diamonds.

This song’s instrumental is produced by Wheezy, who frequently produces songs for Future. It is also co-produced by MIKE DEAN, who frequently produces songs for Travis.

A snippet of this song surfaced to the public a few hours before its release of Future playing the song in the studio with Travis.","[('Sipping on codeine got my screws loose\n Making all this money got my screws loose (Yeah)', [[""While someone having their “screws loose” is a common idiom for acting strange, Future’s direct reference to codeine and Travis Scott and Future’s long history with lean–a street drug which is a mixture of cough syrup (such as codeine) and soda–likely means this is also an allusion to DJ Screw.\n\nDJ Screw is a legendary hip-hop artist from Houston, Texas, who is best known for pioneering the chopped and screwed technique. The chopped and screwed scene was closely connected with lean, both emerging in Houston at the same time, with each contributing to the popularity of the other. Unfortunately, DJ Screw passed away in 2000 due to a suspected lean overdose.\n\nTravis Scott—who is also a Houston native—cited DJ Screw as a major influence in his life. Travis dedicated “R.I.P.

Shortly after the track’s release, Katy took to her social media platforms to share the inspiration behind the song:

I wrote this song a couple [of] months ago as a call to remain true to the course you’ve set for yourself, regardless of what others may think.

She then elaborated on how the song has “taken a new meaning [for her]” after parts of the world went into a lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unlike her past lead singles which tend to be more upbeat and bubbly, “Daisies” features a mid-tempo production in its verses and a guitar in its chorus. This is also Katy’s first time working with The Monsters & Strangerz — an American production and songwriting team who has previously worked on hits like January 2018’s “The Middle.”","[('I’m the Hail Mary', [['A Hail Mary is a football play where the quarterback attempts to throw a last-minute long pass to score. It’s typically unsuccessful, and is often used as a last resort, but when it works, it’s a huge game-changer and proves the tenacity of the team.\n\nDrawing this comparison, Katy shows how far she’ll go to fight for herself, even if her plans seem out of reach.']]), ('I’m the small town\n One in seven billion\n Why can’t it be me?', [['The towns represent the people out of the world.

It promotes the idea of anti-bullying and standing up against name-calling. The original rhyme is:\n\nSticks and stones may break my bones\nBut words will never hurt me.\n\nThis is not the first time Katy has referenced the rhyme in her music. On February 2012’s “Part of Me,” she sings:\n\nThrow your sticks and your stones\nThrow your bombs and your blows\nBut you’re not gonna break my soul\n\nOn “Daisies,” Katy Perry adds a twist to the well-known rhyme by detailing how she used the “sticks and stones” thrown at her to grow as a person.\n\nFans have noted that Katy could also be alluding to a line from June 2019’s “You Need To Calm Down” by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift where she sings:\n\nAnd snakes and stones never broke my bones\n\nBoth Katy and Taylor had a well-documented infamous feud back in 2014 due to some issues related to the dancers for their tours in December of 2013.

The track was first mentioned on his Instagram on May 23, 2020, when he claimed it would be out six days later and the post’s most liked comment would be the song title. This turned out to be his own suggestion of the decided name. The release was then pushed back to June 12 in support of the black community and the protests that broke out due to the killing of George Floyd. 6ix9ine stated this was “out of respect for what we are going through right now.”

“TROLLZ” takes the shape of a catchy, fast-paced trap beat that features uncharacteristically soft vocals from 6ix9ine on the chorus and the quintessential Minaj formula of a verse packed full of wordplay and a sung section.","[('[Refrain: CanonF8]', [['CanonF8 is 6ix9ine’s close friend.

Nicki uses this line to hyperbolize Meek’s tendency of being photographed with those more successful than him and his desire to receive a metaphorical stamp of approval from his mentors and peers.

Nicki further disses her by connecting, “Even your man know Nickis do it better” to the fact that LisaRaye’s husband allegedly cheated with Nicole Murphy, as “Nicki” is a nickname for “Nicole.”\n\nThe opening line may also be pulling a reference from Rae Sremmurd’s hit “Come Get Her,” tying in with LisaRaye’s stripper status:\n\nSomebody come get her, she’s dancin' like a stripper""]]), ('Baddies to my left and my right', [['Known for praising her posse, this line connects to a lyric from her 2018 collaboration “Woman Like Me” with Little Mix.

Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here

The track comes just days after Baby went out and protested on the streets of Atlanta on June 8, 2020. At the protest, Baby was a leading force, leading the crowd on his bicycle (as depicted on the single’s cover art) as well as handing out protestors supplies and money and speaking in front of the crowd when they reached the march’s destination of Georgia’s State Capitol Building.","[('They trainin’ officers to kill us, then shootin’ protestors with these rubber bullets', [['Although police officers in the United States are not explicitly trained to kill African Americans, several factors contribute to the continuation of police brutality against African Americans. The main reason is racial bias: racial profiling has been prevalent for centuries and continues to happen today, with countless stories of detainments, investigations, arrests, and convictions based on the color of the suspect’s skin. It is also well known that some U.S. police departments have a culture of prioritizing the protection of their officers over civilians. This protection enables officers to commit brutality without fear of consequence.\n\nIn this line, Lil Baby emphasizes that police continue to use excessive force against demonstrators protesting police brutality.\n\nWhen protests ensued after the murder of George Floyd, some police departments responded with police donning riot gear and crowd control measures such as rubber bullets. Some states mobilized their national guard to respond to large gatherings that had the potential of becoming unlawful assemblies.\n\nFor example, on June 1, 2020, demonstrators gathered in Washington D.C., near the White House for a largely peaceful protest. However, at 6:30 p.m., 30 minutes before curfew, several federal law enforcement agencies in riot gear advanced on crowds, using brute force, flash bangs, tear gas, and rubber bullets to disperse the legal assembly.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxYmILDya0A\n\nDuring the police’s advancements on the protestors, Australian viewers watched in horror as an Australian 7NEWS crew was assaulted live on television. An armored policeman struck the cameraman in the gut with a shield and another policeman hit the reporter’s backpack with a baton.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkf-znzWKRc\n\nThis line points out the irony of police using excessive force (as seen in the videos) during a protest against that same brutality.']]), ('It’s too many mothers that’s grieving\n They killing us for no reason\n Been going on for too long to get even', [['Black and African American people have undergone 400+ years of discrimination in the United States. Slavery, until 1865 when the 13th Amendment was passed. And after the ending of slavery, they have undergone de jure (legal) and de facto (in practice) discrimination. Legal discrimination (more commonly known as segregation or Jim Crow laws) on race ended with the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nIn conclusion, 400+ years of historical wrongs cannot really be corrected to ever “get even”. There is much debate on what could/should be done this article covers the proposal of reparations, which is one of the many suggestions.\n\n“They killing us for no reason” can be seen in the many harrowing stories of killings of Black people, whether that be by police or racist people; for example, the lynchings that happened throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nOne of the most high-profile cases of this was the murder of Ahmaud Arbery which was A clear-cut case of racial profiling. Where Ahmaud was confronted for jogging through a neighborhood by two men with a shotgun.

It was released in the final hours of Juneteenth, the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States.

On the track, Beyoncé proudly sings about her heritage, hometown, womanhood, and complexion. She also talks about returning to her African roots.

According to her official website, the proceeds of “BLACK PARADE” will go to the BeyGOOD Black Business Impact Fund. The fund is administered by the National Urban League and will be used to support black-owned small businesses in need.

This is Beyoncé’s second release of 2020, after she featured on Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage Remix” in April.","[('Nip that lip like lipo (Lipo)', [['This line might refer to a mother giving their teat to a child to suck. It is clearly from the mother’s perspective, because the “nip” (the maternal, providing body part) executes the action, while the lip (the juvenile, receiving body part) is the object of the sentence. Thus, this phrase enforces the song’s significant themes of motherhood, aligning with the presence of terms like “mama” and “motherhood.” The comparison to “lipo” — liposuction — is principally a play-on-words, but also implies that the mother is made more beautiful by providing for her children.']]), ('Need peace and reparation for my people (Woo)', [['Beyoncé joins the call for the payment of reparations—a form of monetary compensation for past harms done. Reparations paid towards marginalized groups in the U.S.—specifically descendants of enslaved persons—have entered into the mainstream conversation of U.S. politics, even appearing on several Democratic primary stages. A major contributor to cultural consciousness around the need for reparations among recent years, Ta-Nehisi Coates made a compelling argument for reparations in his “A Case For Reparations”:\n\nTo celebrate freedom and democracy while forgetting America’s origins in a slavery economy is patriotism à la carte. Perhaps no statistic better illustrates the enduring legacy of our country’s shameful history of treating black people as sub-citizens, sub-Americans, and sub-humans than the wealth gap. Reparations would seek to close this chasm. But as surely as the creation of the wealth gap required the cooperation of every aspect of the society, bridging it will require the same.']]), ('I charge my crystals in a full moon', [['African people were the first to use crystals, primarily as a decorative material for their bodies, along with other objects from the Mother Nature.\n\nNowadays, believes and religions use semiprecious rocks (i.e. crystals like amethyst and quartz) in metaphysical purposes, such as healing and energizing processes.\n\nThe full moon is a very important symbol in the esoteric believes, referred as a feminine entity, acting as a cleansing and energizing element to the crystals, very useful for someone as demanded as Beyoncé.']]), ('Hol’ up, don’t I smell like such a nag champa incense?', [['Nag Champa is a popular fragrance of incense originating from India. It has a sweet sandalwood scent and is also used in soap, essential oils, and candles.']]), ('Stroll line to the barbeque', [['A stroll line is a line of synchronized dancers at an event that are usually all from the same Greek letter organization. DO NOT TRY TO WALK IN BETWEEN THEM, it is offensive. Here is some deeper background on strolling.\n\nThough Beyoncé is not Greek herself, she has shown major support for black Greek life and HBCU culture in her Homecoming Coachella performance and Netflix documentary.\n\nThe divine nine, the nine widely recognized black fraternity and sorority organizations listed here in Greek in founding order: ΑΦΑ, ΑΚΑ, ΚΑΨ, ΩΨΦ, ΔΣΘ, ΦΒΣ, ΖΦΒ, ΣΓΡ, ΙΦΘ. Beyoncé paid homage to the rich history and culture of these organizations in her homecoming performance, especially in the “bug-a-boo” section where she had male dancers pretending to be pledged by her and her female dancers.\n\nStroll lines are how Greeks identify themselves at functions and events. They can be seen making their way through the outskirts of a party or right in the middle! Black Greek letter organizations utilize signature moves and exude pride and cultural relevance.']]), ('Children’ runnin’ through the house to my art, all black\n Ancestors on the wall, let the ghosts chit-chat\n (Ancestors on the wall, let the ghosts chit-chat)', [['From Dissect Podcast on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/dissectpodcast/status/1274445291228327940']]), ('Here I come on my throne, sittin’ high\n Follow my parade, oh, my parade', [['From Dissect Podcast on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/dissectpodcast/status/1274440283149578240']]), ('Whenever mama say so, mama say', [['This line may be a subtle allusion to Manu Dibango’s 1972 afro-funk classic, “Soul Makossa,"" whose refrain was later popularized by Michael Jackson on his November 1982 Thriller track, “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’”:\n\nMama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\nMama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\n\nSupposedly, Michael claimed that the phrase was Swahili in order to avoid paying royalties, but Dibango filed a lawsuit and the two ended up settling out of court. According to a 2009 The Guardian article, Dibango’s lawyers sued again when Rihanna used the same sample without his permission on her September 2007 hit single, “Don’t Stop the Music.""']]), ('Curtis Mayfield on the speaker (Woo)', [['Curtis Mayfield was an African American soul singer, composer, and producer, especially well known for his July 1972 Super Fly soundtrack. The way he explored the struggles of Black America also helped to contribute to the Civil Rights movement.\n\nFor example, Mayfield discussed race relations and political tensions in the United States on his September 1970 single, “(Don’t Worry) If There’s a Hell Below, We’re All Going to Go,” from his self-titled major label debut:\n\nSisters\nBrothers and the whiteys\nBlacks and the crackers\nPolice and their backers\nThey’re all political actors\n\nAnother song from that album, titled “The Makings of You,” was featured in the behind-the-scenes video of Beyoncé’s September 2018 cover-shoot for Vogue, which she reportedly had “editorial rule” over.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SK58OIqycM']]), ('Lil’ Malcolm, Martin mixed with mama Tina (Woo)', [['Here, Beyoncé is listing some of her key influences.\n\nMalcolm Little was the birth name of Malcolm X (later El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz). Malcolm X stopped using his birth surname in 1952 as he rejected the use of a Western-style family name that was likely imposed on his ancestors when they were transported as slaves to the US.\n\nMalcolm X remains a controversial figure in the Civil Right Movement but Beyoncé has shown her support for him previously, posting a message on her website celebrating his birthday in May 2020. Bey has previously referenced him on “Don’t Hurt Yourself”  and was shouted out by JAY-Z on the joint track “Black Effect”\n\n“Martin” likely refers to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, a central figure of the Civil Rights Movement whose work is still a cornerstone of the dialogue around modern race relations.\n\nFinally, Tina Knowles is literally Beyoncé’s mother. Elevating her mother to be equals to these giants of black political thought underlines how much value Beyoncé places on family.']])]","['shes backkkkkk', '“Black Parade” in honor of Juneteenth.

High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending

I knew you

Running like water, I

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

Its music video — which was written and directed by Taylor and shot during the COVID-19 pandemic — finds Taylor shifting through different places by the magic of playing the piano. She revealed in a Tweet that everyone who was on-set took extra precautions to prevent the spread of the virus:

The entire shoot was overseen by a medical inspector, everyone wore masks, stayed away from each other, and I even did my own hair, makeup, and styling.

“cardigan” is believed to be the first part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of Betty. The storyline is followed by “august” and “betty.” Swift explained in a livechat the night of folklore’s release:

There’s a collection of three songs I refer to as The Teenage Love Triangle. These three songs explore a love triangle from all three people’s perspectives at different times in their lives.","[('The smell of smoke would hang around this long', [['Before folklore, Swift’s last mention of smoke in her work was on her 2019 track “Daylight,” where she likens it to consequences for her actions or beliefs:\n\nI wounded the good and I trusted the wicked\nClearing the air, I breathed in the smoke\n\nAs a whole, “Daylight” describes her experiences with fame and how things started looking up after her reputation era. However, she still experiences self-doubt and insecurity about what she’s gone through in the spotlight, which she describes on folklore tracks like “peace” and “hoax,” as well as “long story short,” which appears on folklore’s sister album, evermore:\n\nI fell from the pedestal\nRight down the rabbithole\nLong story short, it was a bad time']]), ('Leavin’ like a father', [[""Here Taylor makes use of an ironic simile, a rhetorical device developed by comparing a situation to an opposite idea such as a father, meant to be a permanent, integral part of child’s life, leaving. The overall effect saddens the tone and parallels just how betrayed Betty felt at James' unfaithfulness.\n\nTaylor makes use of another, similar ironic simile on her 2012 track “All Too Well” singing,\n\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise""]]), ('But I knew you’d linger like a tattoo kiss', [['Swift previously used the metaphor of a lingering kiss on her 2010 track “Last Kiss,” but “tattoo kiss” makes the impact feel more permanent:\n\nYour name forever the name on my lips\nJust like our last kiss\n\nTaylor used to wear temporary tattoos pretty often during her Fearless era, and she used tattoos as a metaphor for someone’s impact on her on 2017’s “Dress”:\n\nThere is an indentation in the shape of you\nMade your mark on me, a golden tattoo\n\nThe “golden tattoo” is a metaphor for her relationship with Joe Alwyn, her boyfriend as of the song’s release who co-wrote several songs on folklore. They supposedly met at the May 2016 Met Gala, and in October of that year, Taylor was seen wearing golden temporary tattoos to Drake’s birthday party.']]), ('Playing hide-and-seek and', [['‘hide and seek’  refers to the two-timing nature of secret relationships, suggesting Betty already knew something was wrong before being told. It could also refer to James playing hard to get by ignoring her all week and then giving her his undivided attention on the weekends.\n\nFurthermore, Taylor has released eight different covers for the deluxe edition of her ‘folklore’ album, all with different designs and titles, which have been inspired by some of her lyrics. One of these deluxe editions is named “hide-and-seek”.']]), ('Steppin’ on the last train', [['This lyric parallels sentiments found in Swift’s “The Archer” from her album Lover, where Swift expresses her aversion to commit in relationships using similar imagery:\n\nEasy they come, easy they go\nI jump from the train, I ride off alone\n\n“The last train” is usually the final train before service stops for the night. This line serves as a metaphor for making a last ditch effort to exit a place or situation one doesn’t want to be in. This further highlights the hurt that Betty feels, watching James make a conscious choice not to be with her.']]), ('Tried to change the ending', [[""Taylor refers to the ending of a relationship like that of a piece of  fiction again during this album in the song “exile”:\n\nI think I’ve seen this film before\nAnd I didn’t like the ending\n\nIt’s also present much earlier in her discography in the song “Breathe” from Fearless:\n\nMusic starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,\nIt’s the kinda ending you don’t really wanna see\n\nThis concept is also featured in “New Year’s Day” from Reputation although in a more positive manner:\n\nDon’t read the last page\nBut I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we’re making mistakes""]]), ('Chasin’ shadows in the grocery line', [['“Chasing shadows” is a British phrase used to describe someone looking for something that doesn’t exist or trying to achieve something that is impossible. It seems that Betty is looking for James everywhere she goes even though she knows he isn’t there. This is similar to line from the previous song “the 1”:\n\nI thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn’t though\n\nThe phrase also plays on the Peter Pan reference earlier in the song. In the film Peter and Wendy chase down Peter’s shadow so they can reattach it. Taylor pairs the juvenile idea of chasing shadows like in Peter Pan with the adult task of grocery shopping to suggest that Betty is growing out of her youthful naivety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t the first time Taylor has evoked the magic mundanity of grocery stores in her lyrics. In “Stay Stay Stay” on her 2012 studio album Red she sings:\n\nYou carry my groceries and now I’m always laughing\nAnd I love you, because you have given me no choice but to\nStay, stay, stay\n\n“Stay Stay Stay” depicted a younger Taylor’s idea of what a true, healthy romantic relationship would look like; everyday activities such as grocery shopping can become filled with fun and wonder when done with someone special.']]), ('Vintage tee, brand new phone', [['This line uses the literary device of juxtaposition, placing two contrasting ideas in close proximity, to imply that the relationships we assume exist between age (vintage/new, young/old) and “knowing” are not as clear-cut as they may seem.\n\nThe stanza also details Taylor’s past four musical and personal eras. “Vintage tee, brand new phone” references the RED era, in which her instagram focused on a hipster aesthetic. “High heels on cobblestones” points to her love for the Tribeca area of New York City, where she lived during her 1989 era. She references reputation in “Sequin smile, black lipstick,”  as evidenced in her 2016 Met Gala look. Finally, ""Sensual politics” refers to the Lover era, where she became a more outspoken voice both in politics and in her romance with Joe Alwyn.']]), ('’Cause I knew everything when I was young', [['This lyric is an inversion of a lyric repeated earlier in the song:\n\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing\n\nHere, Betty rejects the idea that young people know nothing –  James expressed this sentiment on the chorus of “betty,” where he tries to win Betty back after cheating on her:\n\nI’m only seventeen, I don’t know anything\n\nIt’s worth noting the retrospective nature of this line, implying Betty is looking back on her relationship with James. Swift explained the song’s context in the folklore album foreword:\n\nA cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later.\n\nSwift may have been inspired by poet Oscar Wilde, who once said “the old believe everything, the middle-aged suspect everything, the young know everything.” However, it’s also plausible she took inspiration from The Admirable Crichton by J.M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan:\n\nI’m not young enough to know everything.']]), ('And I knew you’d come back to me\n You’d come back to me\n And you’d come back to me\n And you’d come back', [[""The idea of a lover coming back is prominent throughout Swift’s discography, appearing on songs like 2010’s “If This Was a Movie” and 2012’s “Come Back… Be Here.” She words it similarly on her October 2014 track “This Love,” which describes an on-and-off relationship:\n\nThese hands had to let it go free\nAnd this love came back to me\n\nLater on “betty,” this sureness is juxtaposed with James' worries, which mirrors how Betty “knew everything when [she] was young.”\n\nBut if I just showed up at your party\nWould you have me? Would you want me?\n\nIt’s also worth noting all the Peter Pan references throughout the song, most prominently with “Peter losing Wendy.” In the 1953 animated Disney version, Wendy says a similar line:\n\nPeter Pan! Oh, Peter! I knew you’d come back.""]])]","['', 'I knew you Peter losing Wendy 😢 that Peter Pan reference 😢', '“When you are young they assume you know nothing” here, Taylor is saying what majority of old people think about younger generations, that teenagers or young adults are stupid and ignorant for not having the same beliefs than old people', 'Taylor Swift is back!!!', 'Queen 👑', '#1 billboard 🔥🔥🔥', 'The Queen Taylor is back.\n\nTo bring us new works of art.', 'This comeback of her was so suddenly and so wonderful!', '', 'loved the fairy vibes and references queen serving like always', 'i feel like this will be a sad song and idk if im prepared for another mental breakdown from taylor hfgliagf', 'OMT!

Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

Taylor contemplates an alternate life in which her old wishes had “come true” and resulted in a relationship with an ex-lover.

Sharing a similar sentiment to Swift’s track “I Almost Do” from October 2012’s Red, “the 1” is a callback to the folk moments from the same record, folk music being a defining influence on folklore.","[('You meet some woman on the internet and take her home', [['Online romance is challenging because oftentimes the lovers live in different places or have different backgrounds. Swift’s ex is clearly desperate to find a rebound if his, her, or their only strategy for finding romantic partners is using an online dating service or social media. The Internet is also probably how Swift found out about her ex’s new lover–this person could have posted about the new relationship on social media. Taylor is implying that her ex is dating random wymyn they meet online in order to numb the pain of breaking up with the narrator. It also shows that she’s not moved on yet and she might be jealous thinking he can date other people.\n\nThe online themes of this song are also relevant to the times it was released in. It came out in 2020, when everything had moved online due to COVID-19. Whether or not this song is set during COVID, it definitely fits the times.']]), ('I hit the ground running each night', [['To “hit the ground running” means to rush with enthusiasm right out of the gates, which may be an acknowledgement of Swift’s emotional behavior in romantic relationships.\n\nShe also used this phrase on her 2013 song “Sweeter Than Fiction,” which describes someone making their dreams come true:\n\nThey never saw it coming\nYou hit the ground running\nAnd now you’re onto something']]), ('I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you', [['Swift also wrote about resisting reaching out to an ex on her 2012 song “I Almost Do”:\n\nIt takes everything in me not to call you\nAnd I just wanna run to you\nAnd I hope you know that every time I don’t\nI almost do']]), ('And if my wishes came true', [['A callback to the previous line – tossing coins into a pool (more often, a fountain) is said to be a way of making a wish.\n\nThis tradition has been passed down through the generations – in the days when clean water was a precious gift from the gods, offerings would be left near fountains. Today, we’ve modernized this ancient ritual, throwing money in exchange for a wish come true. This is a perfect example of folklore, which is the theme of the album – just one of the millions of ways that stories from people we’ll never know bleed into our own lives and imaginations.']]), ('And if my wishes came true', [['A callback to the previous line – tossing coins into a pool (more often, a fountain) is said to be a way of making a wish.\n\nThis tradition has been passed down through the generations – in the days when clean water was a precious gift from the gods, offerings would be left near fountains.

With the phrase “another time,” she admits that she has, not once, but on multiple occasions, dug out these memories. If Swift is singing as herself, this could suggest that this is not the first song she recorded for the One.\n\nThe line’s morbid imagery is echoed on the album’s fifth track, “my tears ricochet”, which also uses death as a metaphor for the end of a relationship.\n\nif I’m dead to you, why are you at the wake?']]), ('I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn’t though', [['Swift sings this very casually — she’s trying to sound as though she’s completely moved on, and is looking for small talk, but she shows her hand here. Seeing someone’s face in a crowd is often a sign that you’re thinking about that person, enough to imagine them where they aren’t — she first mentioned this idea on 2012’s “Holy Ground”:\n\nSometimes I wonder how you think about it now\nAnd I see your face in every crowd\n\nShe described the phenomenon again on 2016’s “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever”:\n\nI see you around in all these empty faces\n\nThere’s also a sharp contrast from “I Forgot That You Existed,” the opener to her previous album, Lover. On “I Forgot That You Existed,” Swift insists that she’s moving on from a bad situation and started the album on a positive note, while “the 1” sets a more melancholy, reflective tone for folklore.']]), ('Rosé flowing with your chosen family\n And it would’ve been sweet\n If it could’ve been me', [['A “chosen family” are the people you choose to surround yourself with, whether it’s your friends or a partner. Swift returns to this idea on “peace,” which she wrote about her relationship with Joe Alwyn:\n\nWhen two people understand each other\nFamily that I chose\nNow that I see your brother as my brother\n\nThe bittersweet track “seven” also touches on the idea of a chosen family, with a young girl trying to help her friend leave a potentially abusive household:\n\nI think you should come live with me\nAnd we can be pirates so you won’t have to cry']]), ('And if you wanted me, you really should’ve showed', [['This line is startlingly similar to the sentiment expressed in the bonus track The Moment I Knew from the deluxe edition of Swift’s album Red. The song details the real life story of Taylor’s ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal not showing up to her birthday party, with it being the moment Swift knew the relationship would not work out.']]), ('You know the greatest loves of all time are over now', [['This lyric is reminiscent of Swift’s 2019 track “Death By a Thousand Cuts,” another song about a lost love:\n\n\nWhat once was ours is no one’s now\n\nYou said it was a great love, one for the ages\nBut if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?\n\n\nBy stating that the greatest loves of all time are already over she’s implying that for a love to be that great it must come to a conclusion before things go south.  The downfall is inevitable, but by ending on a great note, the song’s character is left wondering what could have been of their love.']])]","['this is such an intro. some state of grace type of shit', 'Just what we needed during these shitty times!!

I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

This is what makes it such an iconic item on a dancefloor.']]), ('When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns', [['Swift explained this line to Jack Antonoff in folklore: the long pond studio sessions, sharing the lyric’s relevance to the lockdowns caused by COVID-19:\n\nIt also is the first time, and one of the only times, that the time that we’re living through is actually lyrically addressed. I think that, you know, the pandemic and lockdown, and all that, runs through this album like a thread because it’s an album that allows you to feel your feelings, and it’s a product of isolation. […] This is the first time, in the bridge saying, ‘they called off the circus, burned the disco down. When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns.’ I wrote this song right after I found out all my [Lover] shows were canceled. So it’s like I realize, here I am writing all this music, still trying.']]), ('I’ve never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try', [['This line nods to the later folklore track “this is me trying,” on which Swift opens up about insecurity and self-doubt:\n\nI just wanted you to know\nThat this is me trying\nAt least I’m trying\n\nSwift discussed this connection in folklore: the long pond studio sessions:\n\nIn folklore, there are a lot of songs that reference each other, or lyrical parallels, and one of the ones I like is the entire song ‘this is me trying’ then being referenced again in ‘mirrorball.’\n\nProducer Jack Antonoff added:\n\nI remember that being an interesting [lyric] for you to actually put down. Because I remember you said it, and you did it, and you were like, ‘should I say that? Should I?’\n\nSwift laughed, “I was like, ‘is that too true?’”']]), ('I’ll get you out on the floor', [['Taylor Swift is best known for her upbeat music, the kind that would get party attendees out of their seats and onto the dance floor. Specifically, her most popular song is “Shake It Off,” an upbeat dance anthem. When describing her vision for the song, Swift stated:\n\nFrom the second the song starts, I want it to be the song where like, if it’s played at a wedding, and there’s this one girl who hasn’t danced all night at the reception, all her friends come over to her, and they’re like, “You have to dance! Come on! You have to dance on this one!”\n\nNotably, however, the sound of this song is nothing like “Shake It Off,” giving this particular description of her work a more personal touch – she’s setting her image aside to tell you what she thinks about it.']]), ('Burned the disco down', [['Likely a reference to the song “Panic” by The Smiths, which bemoans the state of pop music, saying:\n\nBurn down the disco\nHang the blessed DJ\nBecause the music that they constantly play\nIt says nothing to me about my life\n\nSwift is best known as a pop artist, but this album is her first to be classified as “alternative.” With this reference, Swift seems to be saying that contemporary society has taken the direction advised in “Panic,” and done away with pop music. Rather than throw in the towel, she’s changed her sound to fit the times.\n\nThis is made all the more pointed with the connection to the song’s extended metaphor – a mirrorball is also called a disco ball, with the disco being the place where Swift was metaphorically on display.']]), ('And they called off the circus', [['This could be a reference to the phrase, “media circus”, as many events in her life have become media circuses. In fact, even leaving her apartment is a media event for Swift, as shown in Miss Americana.\n\nHowever, in 2016, she went into hiding to stay out of the public eye – and for the first time since she was a teenager, there was no “media circus” following her every move. This line could then be referring to a future where Swift’s life and career are no longer being scrutinized by the media or the general population.\n\nThe circus imagery is also echoed in the lines that follow, using common circus elements like clowns, tightropes, and trapezes.']]), ('I’ll show you every version of yourself tonight', [['While mirrorballs are generally used to shine light around a room, they do also function as mirrors–lots of tiny mirrors, reflecting every angle around the room. If you looked very close at a mirrorball, you would essentially see every version of yourself.\n\nIn context of the song’s extended metaphor, however, Swift is saying that her music will bring out every version of a person as well. This could be referencing the common idea that people often bring out a different side of themselves while dancing–a shy person might become very animated when their favorite song is playing. It could also, however, refer to the range her discography offers. You can dance to “Shake it Off” or cry to “All Too Well”–it’s all there.\n\nThis also furthers the song’s theme of image – rather than producing its own light, a mirrorball only reflects. Here, Swift is admitting that rather than being herself, she is trying her hardest to understand other people and making every effort to mirror them.']]), ('And I’m still a believer, but I don’t know why', [['This could be alluding to her spiritual belief in God as a Christian and the differences the mainstream American Evangelical dogma has with her political beliefs. In her 2020 documentary, Miss Americana, she argues with her parents and publicist of why she publicly is endorsing Democrat Phil Bredesen in the 2018 Senate race against pro-life Republican Marsha Blackburn.\n\n“I can’t see another commercial and see Marsha Blackburn disguising these policies behind the words ‘Tennessee Christian values’. Those aren’t Tennessee Christian values. I live in Tennessee. I’m a Christian. That’s not what we stand for.”']]), ('I want you to know\n I’m a mirrorball', [['A mirrorball, or discoball, is a spherical mirror covered object which typically hangs above a dance floor to reflect light. As a result, it casts dark shadows — the lyric “I’ll show you every version of yourself” seems to point to spotlighting both positive and negative qualities.\n\n Swift discussed her tendency to “mirror” what others want from her when Billboard crowned her as their Woman of the Decade in December 2019:\n\nI saw that people love to explain away a woman’s success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn’t do is exactly what I did.\n\nSwift has dressed in mirror-esque outfits for the 2016 Met Gala and the 2018 American Music Awards, where she became the most-awarded female artist in AMA history, before becoming the most-awarded artist overall the next year.\n\nNotably, the 2016 Met Gala is where many believe Swift met Joe Alwyn, her boyfriend as of this song’s release. November 2017’s “Dress” seems to allude to how they were dressed that night:\n\nFlashback when you met me\nYour buzzcut and my hair bleached']]), ('Hush, I know they said the end is near', [['Here, ‘the end’ could have multiple possible interpretations. One is the nearing and inevitable end of the relationship that is predicted by those that are not within it.\n\n“The end” could also be a reference to how a woman’s career in the entertainment industry dies in her thirties. Swift described this phenomenon herself in Miss Americana, saying:\n\nWe do exist in this society where women in entertainment are discarded in an elephant graveyard by the time they’re 35 …. This is probably one of my last opportunities as an artist to grasp onto that kind of success.\n\nIn that context, this could be a promise to her fans, that despite her hitting a milestone, in which the media would deem the end of her career, she could be promising that she will continue to be “shining” just for her fans. In this case, it would be still producing work for her fans.\n\nA third possible connotation is a literal or metaphorical end of the world, as this song and album were composed and released in 2020 during a global pandemic – a situation that is perceived by many as the end of the world as we know it.\nPhoebe Bridgers has a similar line on her song “I Know The End”, which describes an apocalyptical situation:\n\nThe billboard said “The End Is Near”']])]","['when Taylor tells you to HUSH….you HUSH', 'idk what a mirrorball is but im HERE FOR IT', 'JACK DID THAT!!

I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-seven-lyrics,1055,218,en,0.9999988638315856,2020-08-08,Taylor Swift,"This song is about one of Taylor’s childhood friends who seemed to have an unhappy life at home. Taylor reflects back on her innocence back then, how she thought the problems could be easily solved.

This is reminiscent of the song “It’s Nice to Have A Friend”, from August 2019 album Lover, which talks about a childhood friend that Taylor grows up with and eventually marries.","[('Are there still beautiful things?', [['She is wondering if such beauty still exists and can still be felt. She is remembering weightlessness and returning to the ground and reality, wondering if such freedom, happiness, and love can be true again in adulthood and in a bleak pandemic']]), ('And though I can’t recall your face\n I still got love for you', [['Like a folk tale, the origins of her memories with this girl are blurred. In explaining the meaning of the title of the album, Swift explained:\n\nThe lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and fiction become almost indiscernible.\n\nRegardless, her love for her childhood friend carries into her life today – she still loves her, and that love influences her emotions, regardless of who they’re for, a similar theme to the one she explored in “It’s Nice to Have a Friend.”. Similarly, the origins of a folk tale may be lost to history, but these stories still impact our lives and become a part of us.']]), ('Cross your heart, won’t tell no other', [['This lines plays on the childhood rhyme:\n\nCross my heart and hope to die\nStick a needle in my eye\n\nThe rhyme is an oath taken when assuring someone you will keep a promise or secret.\n\nIn the first chorus, Swift sings “cross your heart,” stating that her friend is taking the oath and keeping some sort of secret for her. The pronouns are then reversed in the second chorus, with Swift now assuring her friend that she will keep her secret, which most likely involves the tumultuous home life she revealed in the second verse. Ironically, if that is the case, she has just broken her oath – after 23 years.']]), ('Passed down like folk songs\n The love lasts so long', [['Swift alludes to the title and embodiment of the album, folklore. She further explained this:\n\nA tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. […] Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone’s secrets written in the sky for all to behold.\n\nThis ties in with the innocent and supernatural themes of this song. Traditionally, folk music is passed down generation through generation, and, in most cases, solely passed orally.\n\nIn a similar fashion, much of Swift’s own music will be passed through generations thanks to the immense impact that she’s made on the music industry since her start in 2006. She has made an enormous name for herself, breaking hundreds of musical records, including one with folklore where she surpassed the record for most streams and album copies sold within twenty-four hours of release. Playing into this idea, Swift tells her fans that it’s “up to you to pass [the stories on folklore] down.”']]), ('And I’ve been meaning to tell you\n I think your house is haunted\n Your dad is always mad and that must be why', [['These lines mix the idea of Swift’s childhood innocence with the bitter reality of a man’s troubling adulthood. While seven-year-old Swift isn’t entirely sure of why her friend’s father is “always mad,” she still takes it upon herself to piece the puzzle together. She comes to the naïve conclusion that the physical house in which her friend lives possesses a haunted presence, which is the logical explanation for the father’s troubles. She builds onto her childlike ideology and solutions in the subsequent lines:\n\nAnd we can be pirates\n\n\n\nFrom a different perspective, there could be a more internal connection to the father’s anger. Children are often sheltered from family issues or struggles in order to keep their uncontrollable minds at ease. Swift’s friend’s father could have encountered a serious setback in his work or personal life that he’s kept quiet from his daughter. However, he is not managing to hide his anger and frustration about the subject well enough, to the point where even Swift can pick up on it.\n\nThe fear that Swift’s friend feels from her father’s anger is echoed throughout the entire verse, hinting that there is, in fact, a darker meaning to the lyrics. A few lines later, Swift sings:\n\nThen you won’t have to cry\nOr hide in the closet']]), ('Pack your dolls and a sweater\n We’ll move to India forever', [['Taylor Swift explained that the concept for folklore “started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity.” For this song, she pictured “hushed tones of ‘let’s run away’ and never doing it.”\n\nPerhaps Swift chose India to run away to because the country is brimming with folklore; the nation houses over 1,200 languages and boasts a plethora of different cultures and traditions throughout each geographical region.\n\n\n\n Map of the spread of languages throughout India\n\nSwift asks her childhood friend to pack only two items. These two items further prove Swift’s innocence and burning desire to leave, as a sweater isn’t necessarily the smartest piece of clothing to bring to a country like India.']]), ('Please picture me in the trees', [['Just like in her October 2014 song “Wildest Dreams,” Swift asks that they remember her in a certain way:\n\nSay you’ll remember me\nStanding in a nice dress\nStaring at the sunset, babe\nRed lips and rosy cheeks\n\nThe trees might also refer to Taylor’s childhood, as she grew up on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania. Explaining how the album came to be, Swift revealed that “it started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity.” One of those images being “the tree swing in the woods of my childhood.”\n\nIn folklore: the long pond studio sessions, Swift explains:\n\nWith ‘seven,’ the song, I was looking back on it. I’ve always wondered when I see a kid throwing a massive tantrum in a grocery store, like, part of me is like, ‘man, I feel you.’ Like, when did I stop doing that when I was upset? When did I stop being so outraged that I would throw myself on the floor and throw the cereal at my mom? […] Obviously, you know, we can’t be throwing tantrums all the time, and we learned that that’s not the right thing to do, but there’s something lost there too.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Taylor Swift released a collector’s edition of folklore called “in the trees”:\n\n\n\nAnd another one called “in the weeds”:\n\n\n\nThe eight different collector’s editions, that were available to purchase for one week after the release, were created to celebrate that this is her eighth studio album.']]), ('Love you to the Moon and to Saturn', [['This line references the popular children’s bedtime story Guess How Much I Love You, responsible for the original quote\n\nI love you right up to the moon – and back.\n\nThe book gained popularity in the early 1990s in both the United States and the United Kingdom, and eventually became a common promise shared particularly among young girls all the way into motherhood.\n\nSwift adding “and to Saturn” stretches the original quote to capture the full extent of her affections, tinged with motherly care and concern. The phrase could also represent an inside joke or secret language that Swift shared with her friend.']]), ('With Pennsylvania under me', [['Taylor Swift was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, and spent much of her early childhood growing up on her family’s Christmas tree farm in the nearby town of Wyomissing. Swift sang about her childhood on the farm on her 2019 single “Christmas Tree Farm:”\n\nIn my heart is a Christmas tree farm\nWhere the people would come\nTo dance under sparkling lights […]\nAnd I just wanna be there tonight\n\nBy saying her childhood home is “under” her, Swift might be claiming she’s grown up and moved to a different stage in her life, or she could be referencing her move to Nashville, Tennessee that influenced her interests in a musical career. She’s also commenting on how now that she’s older she’s able to see the whole picture now and understand more.']]), ('And we can be pirates', [['Swift references this childhood game on her 2008 track “The Best Day”:\n\nIt’s the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs']])]","['Seing karlie comments already is ridiculous. Nothing in the songs hints to her also a women can love another women without it being sexual. Do y’all not love your friends ? As a bi women y’all need to stop forcing a sexuality on her to fit your ship and otp. It’s creepy and toxic.', 'This is clearly a song about child friendship with a girl whose dad was abusive. Hence the hiding in the closet. Chill', 'gay? I sure hope so.', 'HIDE IN THE CLOSET??? WHATS GOING ON-', 'i’m 99% sure “hide in the closet” is probably a reference to her friend literally hiding in the closet from her abusive parent', 'where are my indian swifties at !!', 'INDIAN SWIFTIES WE WON FOR ONCE', '“love you to the moon and to saturn”', 'Y’all are dumb. Her friend obviously hid in a closet because she lived in an abusive household. Stop assuming the sexuality of a seven year old.', 'this is wlw no het', 'Taylor really made me cry at 7 am', 'honestly angelic we do not deserve', 'This is about realizing that you had a childhood friend who has been through abuse, possibly violence. And you couldn’t do anything about it.\n“I think your house is haunted\nYour dad is always mad and that must be why”', 'this song is about remembering a past love and realizing we still love them thus the lyrics “And though I can’t recall your face I still got love for you”', 'this second verse… made me cry. im loving this album so far.', 'Ok, I know I’m gay and all but… Calm the fuck down she’s with Joe.

I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least I'm trying

And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

Fear, alcohol, and a sense of failure and isolation complicate the healing process, but she takes the first step by having the humility to admit things are difficult and uncertain.

October 2014’s “I Wish You Would,” another collaboration with Jack Antonoff, offers a similar narrative with parallels in imagery and language (driving cars, flashbacks, anger, and regrets), but here she is more proactively taking risks and putting herself out there, even though she still doesn’t have the perfect solution.","[('[Verse 2]', [['On a conversation with Jack Antonoff for folklore: the long pond studio sessions, she explained the second verse:\n\nAnd the second verse is about someone who felt like they had a lot of potential in their life. I think there are a lot of mechanisms for us in our school days, in high school or collage, to excel and to be patted on the back for something and I think a lot of people get out of school and there are less abilities for them to get gold stars. Then, you have to make all these decisions and you have to pave your own way, there’s no set class course you can take and I think a lot of people feel swept up in that. So I was thinking about this person who is really lost in life and then starts drinking and every second is trying not to.']]), ('[Verse 1]', [['On a conversation with Jack Antonoff for folklore: the long pond studio sessions, they explained the first verse:\n\nTaylor:\n\nI had this idea that the first verse would be about someone who is in sort of a life crisis and has just been trying and failing in their relationship, has been messing things up with people they love, has been letting everyone down, and has driven to this overlook, this cliff, and is just in the car going “I could do whatever I want in this moment and it could affect everything forever”, but this person backs up and drives home.\n\nJack:\n\nI love that, the idea that not driving off the cliff is an act of trying, which is almost the ultimate act of trying.']]), ('But I didn’t pour the whiskey', [['PROPOSED SUGGESTION:\n\nThis line connects with the previous and basically sets up that this character is pouring out their heart to a bartender at a bar.

Her saying I don’t quite know what to say literally means that for this album, she literally doesn’t know what topics to include about as this is a new genre for her (alternative) and also the first album where majority of the songs are not about her life as opposed to her older albums which are about her mostly.']]), ('Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here', [['This is not the first time Taylor uses a school-inspired lyric. Besides her first songs written in her youth, “Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince”, from her 6th studio album Lover, uses the school as a metaphor to her relationship and politics:\n\nThey whisper in the hallway “she’s a bad, bad girl” (Okay)\nThe whole school is rolling fake dice\nYou play stupid games you win stupid prizes\nIt’s you and me, there’s nothing like this\nMiss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince\n\nThis part can also refer to the music industry as her classmates, referring to 2016’s summer and the Kanye West feud with her when she “fell behind” her classmates. In  her 2017’s single, “Look What You Made Me Do”, she said:\n\nI don’t like your kingdom keys\nThey once belonged to me\n\nIn “this is me trying” she realize she has been through a lot and “ended up here”.']]), ('So I got wasted like all my potential', [['This line has a double meaning:\n1. Earlier in this song, the narrator said:\n\nI had the shiniest wheels, now they’re rusting\n\nAnd later in this verse, they say:\n\nI was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere\n\nAlong with these two other lyrics, this line highlights that the narrator had a lot of early success and potential, which they now feel was largely wasted. This is one of the things about which they have a lot of regrets.\n2. The verse ends with the line:\n\nPouring out my heart to a stranger\nBut I didn’t pour the whiskey\n\nTo “get wasted” is to get drunk or inebriated. Together with the later line, this hints that the song is at least partly about alcoholism or, more metaphorically, addiction.']]), ('Pouring out my heart to a stranger', [['This line evokes an image of an alcoholic sitting at a bar, rambling on about their problems to the bartender or another patron. The following line, “but I didn’t pour the whiskey,” could mean, “maybe this isn’t the best behavior, but I didn’t pour the alcohol, so at least I’m trying.” This could be literal, or could be intended in a more metaphorical sense of someone who’s struggling not to go back to their bad habits, like an old ex. Taylor has used metaphors of “love as a drug” before, notably in 1989’s Clean and reputation’s Don’t Blame Me.\n\nIn addition, Verse 1 ends with:\n\nI’m here in your doorway\n\nThere’s no real reason to assume that the subject/person being spoken to has changed since Verse 1, and that subject is clearly an ex or former friend. The fact that Taylor now calls the subject “a stranger” is actually reminiscent of a line from reputation’s New Year’s Day:\n\nPlease don’t ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere\n\nThis reinforces the idea that the subject has not changed, and she is still speaking to the ex. She’s standing here, pouring her heart out to someone who she used to love but no longer knows, but at least it’s better than drinking away her problems. She’s trying.']]), ('You’re a flashback in a film reel', [['This harkens back to the lyric from exile “I think I’ve seen this film before / And I didn’t like the ending”\nhttps://genius.com/20415392\n\nThis film motif is present throughout the album. Namely, in “the 1,”\n\nI hit the Sunday matinee\nYou know the greatest films of all time were never made\n\nAnd in “hoax,”\n\nYou knew the hero died, so what’s the movie for?']]), ('I have a lot of regrets about that', [[""This line actually contradicts an interview Taylor gave to Billboard which was published only 7 months before this song was released where she states she wouldn’t change anything about her past:\n\nI would have done everything exactly the same way. Because even the really tough things I’ve gone through taught me things that I never would have learned any other way. I really appreciate my experience, the ups and downs. And maybe that seems ridiculously Zen, but … I’ve got my friends, who like me for the right reasons. I’ve got my family. I’ve got my boyfriend. I’ve got my fans. I’ve got my cats.\n\nHowever, Taylor did seem to begin expressing doubt in her past actions in her previous album Lover (released 4 months before the interview) including the pre chorus from “You Need To Calm Down”:\n\nAnd I ain’t tryna mess with your self-expression\nBut I’ve learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' ‘bout somebody else is no fun\n\nAlso, the coronavirus lockdown of 2020 (during which Taylor wrote this song) has been a time of personal reflection for many. It’s highly possible that Taylor took this time to look at her past actions and critique them. Multiple songs on the album potentially touch of past regrets including “The 1”:\n\nIn my defense, I have none\nFor never leaving well enough alone""]])]","['this is me crying', 'track 9s are always one of the best songs on the album – wildest dreams, cornelia street….', 'they told me all of my cages were mental, so i got wasted like all my potential', 'YOU’RE A FLASHBACK IN A FILM REEL', 'This song reminds me a lot of “Back to December.” It’s got a lot of those same themes of missing someone you lost, yet not quite really knowing how to fix it– all you can say “I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,” and hope that it’s enough.', '“And my words shoot to kill when I’m mad.

About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-betty-lyrics,2182,455,en,0.9999981652711278,2020-08-08,Taylor Swift,"“betty” touches on the aftermath of “august,” which describes a summer love that was doomed from the start. Listeners learn that while the summer affair was going on, the speaker, James, was still dating their classmate, Betty.

The song takes a more feminist approach, portraying the narrator as a person named James who can’t own up to their mistakes, all while Betty flourishes on her own and recognizes her worth.

Sonically, the song exudes a strong sense of nostalgia, delivering production and instrumentals reminiscent to Taylor’s earlier projects like Fearless and Speak Now, both of which were records written by Taylor in her similarly naïve adolescence.

“betty” is believed to be the third part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of James. The storyline is preceded by “cardigan” and “august.”

Interestingly, James' gender is never explicitly stated—James and Inez (mentioned in the pre-chorus) are, in fact, the names of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds‘ eldest daughters—leading some to believe that James could be a girl and that the Teenage Love Triangle is, in fact, a sapphic love story.

However, Taylor confirmed James' gender while explaining the song on country radio:

[James] has lost the love of his life basically and doesn’t understand how to get it back…Everybody makes mistakes, everybody really messes up sometimes and this is a song that I wrote from the perspective of a 17-year-old boy. I’ve always loved that in music you can kinda slip into different identities and you can sing from other people’s perspectives. So that’s what I did on this one–and I named all the characters in this story after my friends' kids.""","[('Betty, right now is the last time', [['This line may be a nod to the many lyrical and thematic similarities “Betty” shares with Taylor’s 2012 track “The Last Time” in which a male narrator finds himself at the door of a lover, whom he has cheated on and broken the heart of, begging for forgiveness.\n\nFurther commonalities exist in both songs as the fictional male partners seek to fix what they have previously broken in their partner with James singing,\n\nIf you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?\nWill it patch your broken wings?\n\nAnd the unnamed male lead of “The Last Time:”\n\nAnd you open your eyes into mine\nAnd everything feels better\n\nIt is also notable how the female partner in each takes back her lover, forgiving his unfaithfulness, with Betty forgiving James being confirmed by Taylor in her Disney+ documentary “Folklore: The Long Ponds Studio Sessions” stating,\n\nIn my head, I think Betty and James ended up together, right? In my head, she ends up with him, but he really put her through it.']]), ('Would you tell me to go fuck myself', [['In the clean version and live performance of “betty,” this line is instead:\n\nWould you tell me to go straight to hell']]), ('Inez', [[""Inez is a friend of Betty and James. She informs Betty of James' infidelity with Augustine (a.k.a. the narrator of “august”).\n\nInez, Betty, and James are named after Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively’s children.\n\nSome fan theories suggest Inez is Abigail and James is the Two-Timer from Picture To Burn.""]]), ('[Chorus]', [['Swift explained in folklore: the long pond studio sessions that Joe Alwyn, her boyfriend as of the song’s release, wrote the chorus under the name William Bowery. She shared:\n\n‘betty’ was… I just heard Joe singing the entire fully formed chorus of ‘betty’ from another room. And I was just like, ‘Hello.’ It was a step that we would never have taken, because why would we have ever written a song together? So this was the first time we had a conversation where I came in and I was like, “Hey, this could be really weird, and we could hate this, so because we’re in quarantine and there’s nothing else going on, could we just try to see what it’s like if we write this song together?” So he was singing the chorus of it, and I thought it sounded really good from a man’s voice, from a masculine perspective. And I really liked that it seemed to be an apology. And I’ve written so many songs from a female’s perspective of wanting a male apology, that we decided to make it from a teenage boy’s perspective apologizing after he loses the love of his life because he’s been foolish.']]), ('You heard the rumors from Inez', [['Inez’s name was likely chosen because it’s the same name as Swift’s friend’s Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively’s daughter, the pair also have another daughter named James, another name in the song.\n\nDue to this, many Swift fans speculated that Blake and Ryan’s third daughter would be named Betty, and that the song was named for her. This was later revealed to be true, making their three children Betty, James, and Inez.']]), ('[Chorus]', [['The key change from C major to D major, a musical symbol of optimism and happiness, closely mirrors the key changes near the end of Swift’s Getaway Car, which uses the same modulation, and Love Story, which changes from D major to E major. Getaway Car also details the entanglements of a love triangle.\n\nAs Chris William of Variety notes, this  key change is reminiscent to Swift’s earlier music, “in case anyone imagines Swift has completely moved on from the spirit of early triumphs.”']]), ('Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard\n When I passed your house\n It’s like I couldn’t breathe', [['This lyric alludes to the concept of Swift’s 2015 song “I Wish You Would”. In the Target Exclusive version of 1989, one of the bonus tracks is a voice memo that breaks down “I Wish You Would.” She says:\n\nOkay, so this is an idea called “I Wish You Would.” It’s kind of about this guy who’s like, he’s driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend’s house and it’s like, he thinks she hate him, but she’s still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this\n\nAs the narrator passes Betty’s house, he’s forced to reflect back on his poor decisions and mistakes that led to their breakup.']]), ('Betty, I’m here on your doorstep', [[""This line beckons back to the lyric in the first song of Taylor’s self-described “Teenage Love Triangle “cardigan”, of which the character Betty knew James would show up at her door:\n\nAnd you’d be standin' in my front porch light\nAnd I knew you’d come back to me\nYou’d come back to me\nAnd you’d come back to me\nAnd you’d come back\n\nThis also echoes the imagery from “How You Get the Girl”, when an ex-lover shows up at the doorstep of a girl, trying to apologize and get her back.\n\nStand there like a ghost\nShaking from the rain, rain\nShe’ll open up the door and say, “Are you insane?”""]]), ('Just thinking of you when she pulled up like\n A figment of my worst intentions\n She said “James, get in, let’s drive”', [['This returns to a lyric on “august”:\n\nRemember when I pulled up\nAnd said ‘Get in the car’\nAnd then canceled my plans just in case you’d call?\n\nSwift explained in a livechat the night of folklore’s release:\n\nThere’s a collection of three songs I refer to as The Teenage Love Triangle.

The song is a revamped sound from the band’s fifth studio album, V, which was released in August 2014. The instrumental of it consists of light drums and harmonized electric guitars and a blending synth keyboard.

Lyrically, the song was inspired by the tough times in the world that were going on at the time of its release: the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests. The band’s lead singer Adam Levine explained the inspiration of the song through an Instagram post and claimed the song’s intention was to give love and hope to the listener about the tough times. This can be read in the Q&A below.","[('If you ever left, I’d go psychotic', [['According to Healthline, psychosis is “characterized by an impaired relationship with reality” (https://www.healthline.com/health/psychosis).

In the folklore album prologue, Swift explains that the song touches on her grandfather’s experience in the military.","[('Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out\n With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)', [['A powerful comparison of healthcare professions amid the COVID-19 pandemic and soldiers on the battlefield. As COVID-19 directly affects the respiratory system, the “breathe in” and “breathing out” lines could refer to a doctor watching a co-worker die of COVID-19, much like a soldier watching fellow service members die in battle.\n\nThere is an even darker undertone with the war comparison that needs to be considered. Many who serve are diagnosed with PTSD, and much like soldiers in battle, we are already seeing the mental health effects this pandemic is having on healthcare professionals. Effects like suicide, much like Veterans with PTSD.\nCheck our my fave website']]), ('Something med school did not cover\n Someone’s daughter, someone’s mother\n Holds your hand through plastic now\n “Doc, I think she’s crashing out”', [['Paralleling the first verse, Swift changes the narrative from the traumatic experiences of war to the raging battle against the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe disease is so contagious that those infected are forced into a quarantine and treated from behind plastic barriers and face-shields to avoid any spreading. To make matters worse, many American hospitals have had to implement the heartbreaking requirement to forbid family members from being the room with a dying loved-one.\n\n\n\n A viral image of a Canadian family embracing through a plastic barrier\n\nAn unprecedented pandemic like COVID-19 is not something that healthcare workers expected to encounter, and, as Swift notes, is not a primary focus of concern during medical school.\n\nThe increase in working hours, protective gear, and fear of contamination has taken an immense toll on healthcare workers, causing some to quit and some to even commit suicide due to the pressure. For many healthcare workers, the aftermath of COVID-19 will be comparable to the PTSD that veterans suffer, which Swift re-mentions in the next line:\n\nAnd some things you just can’t speak about']]), ('With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)', [['This shows that during the Covid-19 pandemic we have all come together to help each other, just like in the war where one army comes together to save a country.']]), ('Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out', [['Taylor wrote this album while quarantining during the COVID-19 global pandemic. One of the deadlier symptoms of the disease is a shortness of breath, with many victims eventually succumbing to some form of respiratory failure.\n\nOne of the most important duties of the medical professionals working on the frontlines of the pandemic is to monitor a person’s vital signs, especially their breathing. This line refers to a medical professional watching a person breathing in and out, making sure that they haven’t succumbed to respiratory failure.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, this line might also reflect a certain moment on the battlefield for soldiers – specifically, the moment when one soldier must watch his compatriot draw their final breaths.']]), ('Only twenty minutes to sleep\n But you dream of some epiphany\n Just one single glimpse of relief\n To make some sense of what you’ve seen', [['These lines are some of many parallels that the song draws between soldiers on the battlefield and healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.\n\nBoth soldiers on the battlefield and healthcare workers, with or without the presence of a pandemic, are required to go a gruellingly long time without sleep or rest in order to help keep people safe and alive. Healthcare workers fall into a routine of taking on shifts that can last anywhere from twelve hours to even forty-eight hours. Oftentimes, the only rest they can find is quick twenty minute naps between patients or crises.\n\nSimilarly, soldiers must take shifts of staying awake to always be on the lookout for any surprise attack or enemy intrusion.\n\n\n\nHere, Taylor describes this moment of rest as being the time when these people in peril dream of some sign that will make sense of all the trauma and hardship they’ve experienced. Sadly, it’s indicated by the tone and the diction that the idea of such a sign is little more than a dream, and that all of the hard work, exhaustion, and horror both soldiers and these healthcare workers are experiencing might not ever make sense.\n\nIt highlights the sacrifice and honor of these professionals, but also the great tragedy of their difficult and under-appreciated work.']]), ('And some things you just can’t speak about', [['Swift repeats this line at the end of the both verses to parallel the distressing experiences of a soldier in a war, more specifically Swift’s own grandfather during the Battle of Guadalcanal, with those of a healthcare worker during the expansive 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile the war and the fight against COVID-19 share obvious differences and circumstances, as of the release of “epiphany,” COVID-19 has already brought around 235,000 deaths within the United States – which is over double the amount of deaths from the Battle of Guadalcanal.']]), ('Keep your helmet, keep your life, son\n Just a flesh wound, here’s your rifle\n Crawling up the beaches now\n “Sir, I think he’s bleeding out”', [['This first verse reminisces on Swift’s grandfather, Dean and his landing on Guadalcanal in 1942. The lyrics touch on the gruelling mental and physical effects of the war, as well as the subsequent PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) that plagues about 40% of all veterans.\n\nThe Battle of Guadalcanal took place on the beaches of the island of Guadalcanal, one of the main islands in south-west Pacific Solomon Islands. The battle took the lives of over 60,000 United States soldiers, as well as about 65% of the Japanese soldiers stationed there.\n\nA photo of Swift’s grandfather during his service is also featured at the beginning of the “cardigan” music video.\n\n\n\nMuch of “epiphany” alludes to characteristics of PTSD and its taxing, long-lasting effects, such as in the later lines of the track:\n\nOnly twenty minutes to sleep\nBut you dream of some epiphany\nJust one single glimpse of relief\nTo make some sense of what you’ve seen']]), ('With you I serve, with you I fall down, down', [['In relation to COVID-19, Taylor can be seen as singing about the medical professionals serving on the frontlines of the crisis, making that sacrifice despite endangering their own lives.\n\nIt also relates to soldiers, who are often referred to as “serving their country” when they enlist and deploy.

Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me

Like August 2019’s “The Archer,” Swift explains her shortcomings in a relationship and hopes that her partner will stay with her in spite of them. However, unlike her own personal flaws explored in “The Archer,” this song focuses on Swift’s fame — she worries that their lack of privacy could drive her partner away.","[('Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?', [['Swift explained the meaning behind “peace” in a November 2020 piece for Rolling Stone:\n\n‘peace’ is actually more rooted in my personal life. [It comes after] carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow. […] Would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?']]), ('Give you my wild, give you a child', [[""Give you a child is clearly a reference to getting pregnant and having a child with her lover. Give you my wild is likely referencing her “crazy” side that she has frequently referenced in her past work.\n\n\n\nBlank Space:\n\nScreaming, crying, perfect storms\nI can make all the tables turn\nRose garden filled with thorns\nKeep you second guessin' like\n“Oh my God, who is she?”\nI get drunk on jealousy\nBut you’ll come back each time you leave\n‘Cause, darling, I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream\n\nDon’t Blame Me:\n\nDon’t blame me, love made me crazy\nIf it doesn’t, you ain’t doin' it right\n\nMe!:\n\nI know that I’m a handful, baby, uh\nI know I never think before I jump\nAnd you’re the kind of guy the ladies want\n(And there’s a lot of cool chicks out there)\nI know that I went psycho on the phone\nI never leave well enough alone\nAnd trouble’s gonna follow where I go\n(And there’s a lot of cool chicks out there)\n\nShe could also mean that she wants to share her Wildest Dreams with him.\n\nAnother interpretation is: to be wild is to be untethered and untamable by others. By saying she will give her wild, Taylor seems to imply that she has found someone for whom she is willing to give up part of that freedom. She also frames it as a gift, further emphasizing how big a deal this relinquishment of “wildness” is to her. She wants to build a family and a life with her partner, and has realized that she can trust him with all of herself. She is ready to go all in, and sees how much there is to gain for their future together by doing so.""]]), ('And you know that I’d swing with you for the fences', [['This line, paired with the following line “sit with you in the trenches,” is her way of saying that she is committed to this relationship for better or worse.  Swinging for the fence is a baseball term that refers to when a batter is swinging with all their might, in hopes that they will hit a homerun.\n\n\n\nUsing another baseball reference, Taylor explains her commitment to the highs and lows of this relationship in a previous song, New Year’s Day:\n\nI’ll be there if you’re the toast of the town, babe\nOr if you strike out and you’re crawling home']]), ('Suddenly this summer, it’s clear', [['Presumably, this song was written during the summer, and the album was released near the end of July.\n\nHowever, in context of the previous line, summer also has metaphorical meaning. Spring is considered a time of growth and change, while summer is relatively stagnant. Many people also associate summer with the long, carefree days of summer break during their childhoods. An earlier song, “august,” describes this feeling:\n\naugust sipped away like a bottle of wine\n‘cause you were never mine\n\nAdditionally, her 2019 song “Cruel Summer” describes a tense secret relationship taking place during the summer. This summer, though, the relationship’s grown more secure. She’s spent 30 years growing and changing, and now she’s in the summer of her life – settling down, and living quietly with the person she loves.']]), ('Our coming-of-age has come and gone', [['Swift acknowledges here that she has made it through her youth and has come of age, having made it through her twenties.\n\nfolklore is the first album Swift has released in her thirties. Many critics have remarked on the maturity of her writing in folklore, such as Rob Sheffield in his Rolling Stone review of the album :\n\nThis is easily her most audacious move, full of story-telling depth she’s never come close to before. Some of us have spent years dreaming Taylor would do a whole album like this, but nobody really dreamed it would turn out this great. Her greatest album — so far.']]), ('All these people think love’s for show', [['Swift has come under fire for faking relationships in the past in order to gain publicity. Her unexpected involvement with English actor Tom Hiddleston was met with a lot of criticism due to the timeline of events: the two were seen public about two weeks after it was confirmed that Swift and Scottish DJ Calvin Harris had broken up, and within a few weeks, the new relationship had began to see several highs and lows.\n\n\n\n Viral photo in 2016 that confirmed “Hiddleswift”\n\nShe began to face criticism against her relationship Joe Alwyn, but subsequently sat down with The Guardian to comment on why she was not going to let critics affect this relationship in the same way they had her previous ones.\n\nNow, three strong years later, Swift has clearly proven that her love towards Alwyn isn’t, in fact, for show, but the most serious it has ever been.']]), ('Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other', [['In her 2015 deluxe track “You Are In Love”, Swift similarly describes the unspoken bond that forms within a loving couple.\n\nYou can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence)']]), ('Sit with you in the trenches', [['This mirrors the wartime imagery on previous folklore track “epiphany”:\n\nKeep your helmet, keep your life, son\nJust a flesh wound, here’s your rifle\nCrawling up the beaches now\n‘Sir, I think he’s bleeding out’\n\nIn the folklore album prologue, Swift explains that the first verse of “epiphany” touches on her grandfather’s experience in the military.']]), ('You paint dreamscapes on the wall', [['Shortly before the premiere of the “cardigan” music video, Swift changed the thumbnail of the video to a picture of a painting, which would later appear on a wall in the video itself.\n\n\n\nThe painting depicts a small house on a hill leading down to a beach. The sky is a swirling gray and the ocean waves roll and crash onto the sand. A rocky mountain lays behind the scene.\n\nSwift was revealed to have painted this during the first week of quarantine.\n\nThe ocean waves may also connect to an earlier line:\n\nIf your cascade, ocean wave blues come']]), ('And it’s just around the corner, darlin’\n ’Cause it lives in me\n No, I could never give you peace', [['Taylor has always believed due to her status as a pop star, she will always be hounded by the press and her detractors. There will never be a forever “calm” in her life. Thus, Taylor laments the lack of stability she can offer her lover.\n\n\n\nThese lyrics are also similar in sentiment to her 2019 track “ME!”:\n\nTrouble’s gonna follow where I go\n\nThese lines also evoke the imagery displayed in the music video of Swift’s song “Lover”, where Swift is in a fishbowl and her titular lover joins her inside of it, representing his willingness to withstand the public eye alongside her.']])]","['“clowns to the west” I see what you did there, Miss Swift, and that was iconic', 'it’s like every time i think i’ve found my favourite song on the album, i go to the next track and reevaluate', 'are we gonna pretend she didn’t say “give you a child”?', 'Taylor saved the 2020', 'Give you my wild, give you a child – YASSSS TAYLOR GIVE US A BABY!

“my future” is Billie Eilish’s first single since the release of her acclaimed February 2020 James Bond theme song “No Time To Die.” After almost a month away from social media, Eilish returned on July 24, 2020, to announce the track and its release date. The cover art and exact time of release for the song were announced later on July 28, 2020.

On July 29, a day before the release date, a snippet of the song was published on Billie’s Instagram page.

The track was released alongside a music video on July 30, 2020.","[('I know supposedly I’m lonely now (Lonely now)\n Know I’m supposed to be unhappy\n Without someone (Someone)\n But aren’t I someone?

And I’m not talking about relationships, I’m talking about everything. I could never be alone. I couldn’t take my own company. I just felt like I needed that growth. I needed a moment to myself and I got it. It was hard, it’s so much harder than you think to not rely on people, to just have yourself to rely on. It’s weird, it’s not something you’d think about being hard but when you’re in that “alone zone” it’s a new feeling. I really wanted to talk about it. Everything is about love. There’s nothing that talks about being alone is really powerful and you grow a lot and you learn a lot and it’s not bad.\n\nBillie struggled with severe separation anxiety during her childhood to the point that one of her parents constantly had to be around her. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Billie’s parents explained that because of her separation anxiety, she slept with her parents until she was 10 or 12.']]), ('’Cause I, I’m in love\n With my future\n Can’t wait to meet her\n And I (I), I’m in love\n But not with anybody else\n Just wanna get to know myself', [['In the chorus, Billie sings about her enthusiasm for the future and what it has in store for her. Billie explained further in an email sent to fans:\n\nwhen we wrote this song, it was exactly where my head was at – hopeful, excited and a craaaazy amount of self reflection and self growth. but recently it has also taken on a lot of new meaning in the context of what’s happening in the world now\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, has impacted countless lives worldwide and caused uncertainty for the future. Billie acknowledges these fears, but she instead chooses to have a more optimistic view of the future. In the email she sent to her fans after the release of “my future,” Billie spoke about maintaining her optimism:\n\nthe future feels uncertain and crazy right now. but i think we need to be ready to put the work in, and if we do that, we should be hopeful and excited for our future. i have to keep reminding myself that the future is ours, and i know we want to do everything we can to make it better for everyone in the world. and for the world itself… it’s up to us to change things now. not only for us, but for future generations. stay hopeful.\n\nIn a July 2020 interview with Zane Lowe, Billie explained the final line of the song:\n\nThere’s still hope in it.

Tenet saw many issues and delays before it’s release (eventually being delayed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic of 2020), but director Christopher Nolan told GQ that Scott’s contribution was “…the final piece of a yearlong puzzle.”

The film finally released on August 21 internationally and September 3 in the United States.

Everyone but The Protagonist believes she will die no matter what, but The Protagonist sees this opportunity as the only option to at least try and save her.\n\nThe Tenet organization uses these two colors to help organize their operations when dealing with inverted people.

Moreover, Travis tattoed the term across the side of his hand in February 2019.\n\nWhen Travis says that it’s time for his fans to “eat,” he is indicating that he’ll be dropping new music for his fans to hear. This phrase was used while promoting his October 2019 chart-topping single, “HIGHEST IN THE ROOM.” In an interview with Zane Lowe, he said:\n\nBut I’m always down to drop music and serve some packs to the fans. It’s time for the fans to eat.']]), ('Ride on land, Boeing jet, make it land', [['In the film Tenet, a Boeing 747 is crashed and blown up in a scene on land. Due to the popular and often over-used method of creating computer-generated special effects in Hollywood films, it was assumed this much-talked about action sequence that was teased in the film’s second trailer would follow suit. Visionary director Christopher Nolan is known for his unique level of practicality, particularly with the hallway fight scene from 2010’s Inception.\n\nCarrying on this tradition of practicality, Nolan purchased and blew up a Boeing 747 since it was cheaper than hiring a visual effects team to create it artificially. In lead star John David Washington’s words:\n\nThat was a real plane, and that was a real building that they crashed that plane into. And we, cast and crew, all witnessed it. It was epic! It was incredible, we all cheered and hurrayed and hurrahed when they yelled cut after Chris felt like he got it. What you saw is really what happened – at least the night I was there.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Warner Bros.

I was goin' through that pain alone
I was goin' through that phase alone
We all change, you say I change alone
Sleepless nights, barely changin' clothes
You know damn right you was wrong
I was tired, they didn't realize
Certain vibes, it don't feel right
Plenty nights got me traumatized
Why they lie? I do love my guys
You lookin' crazy, know the trenches raised me
I'm Durkio, but I'm Chicago JAY-Z
And I was scared how that money made me
I caught a vibe today, was lookin' crazy
Money ran low, right? Felons can't vote, right?
I can't even vote for who I believe in, shit ain't goin' right
I didn't drop a tear inside the funeral, I ain't mourn right
And I nut in all the hoes I fuck, I blame the porn site

Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate tryna turn away, tryna turn away
Became the voice of the streets and my people ain't believe in me
I'm supportive of the streets and them people ain't believe in me
Quarantine what? I'm just tryna make a buck
Talkin' to my dawg, he be actin' like he stuck
Favorite gun a Glock, it slipped up, what a month
Throw it in they face every time I hold it up
Granny ain't feelin' too well
Shootout with the police, I ain't goin' to jail
How you actin' off a case, you'll know if you tell
I know a nigga from the hood, he'll serve with no scale
Watchin' Bands make a play, I seen him score in the mail
Gave him thirty-nine years, I heard him cry in the cell
Even though I'm gettin' big, I bought a MAC through my Zelle
Took a picture on my block, they think I'm back in the field

The official music video was released on September 4, 2020, alongside the track.

On this song, Lil Durk reminisces on his old life in the streets in a sad tone, dropping lines about sexual activity, legal issues, and weapons. While rapping on the two verses, Durk sings with a robotic auto-tune on the chorus.

Lil Durk teased the existence of this song, in early May 2020, when he changed his Twitter name to “THE VOICE.” He then ultimately announced the song’s release date via Twitter on August 28, 2020.","[('I can’t even vote for who I believe in, shit ain’t goin’ right', [['In 2011, Lil Durk was arrested on weapon charges including possession of a firearm with a defaced serial number. Illinois and Chicago have strict gun laws in an attempt to combat gun violence, so when Durk pled guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated unauthorized use of a weapon, he became a convicted felon.\n\nDue to his felon status, Durk lost certain rights such as the right to vote. Considering Durk calls himself “The Voice” and is outspoken about societal issues, it is understandable that he finds it frustrating that he cannot express his political beliefs in elections.']]), ('And I nut in all the hoes I fuck, I blame the porn site', [['Lil Durk blames our overly sexual culture for his dangerous sexual behaviors. Porn portrays women as objects to be used for sex. The use of a condom prevents the spread of AIDS and unintentional pregnancies.']]), ('Quarantine what?

Big Sean, who signed with G.O.O.D. Music in 2007 and released his debut album Finally Famous in 2011, has been at the top of the rap game for nearly a decade, and wants to make it clear that he has no intent of stopping or slowing down.

In an interview with Vulture about Detroit 2, he said:

[Criticism] isn’t something I think about every day. I don’t feel like I have to prove myself. That’s not what I’m thinking about. I’m thinking more like, I gotta offer something that people need. That’s where I am lately, where my mind has been with the music I’ve been making now.","[('Next episode, got the whole fucking world watching\n I might leave the series, come back like I’m Rodman', [['Sean refers to this album as the “next episode” to the first Detroit mixtape, and he knows the world’s been anticipating it like it were the next episode in a television series.\n\nConsistent with the television imagery, Sean uses a play on words to state that he might just leave and come back to this “series” like Dennis Rodman of the 1998 Bulls. By saying this, he’s saying that even if he were to take a break (from a television or playoff series) he would still bounce back with his A-game, as Rodman infamously did.\n\nhttps://thecomeback.com/nba/that-time-dennis-rodman-skipped-a-1998-nba-finals-practice-to-attend-a-wcw-event-then-had-14-rebounds-shut-down-karl-malone-in-game-4.html']]), ('Red Wings jersey B.I.G., look like Pac\n The blacker the berry, more they wan’ see it rot (Rot)', [[""Big Sean reps for the Detroit Red Wings—an ice hockey team based in his hometown. In 1994, journalists captured an image of 2Pac leaving court in a Red Wings jersey, which has turned into a symbol of Detroit pride. In addition, Sean seems to be twisting a few lines from 2Pac’s October 1993 single, “Keep Ya Head Up”:\n\nSome say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nI say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Big Sean, 2Pac, and The Spirit of Detroit in Red Wings jerseys.\n\nThe phrase “the blacker the berry” stems from Wallace Thurman’s 1929 novel of the same name. Sean uses the line to address racism—in  June 2020, protests were ignited by the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. Sean joined protesters in Los Angeles and opened up about partaking in protests on social media:\n\nI don’t know if it’s to make us look like we wild beasts or don’t have control, but we clearly are not wild beasts. We’re extraordinary, talented magical people that if you took us out of the equation, the world would be very, very bland.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Sean uses some clever wordplay by spelling out his rap name, “Big” Sean, to compare himself to The Notorious B.I.G., who feuded with 2Pac in 1995–1996. This is not the first time that Sean spells out his name—on YG’s 2018 track, “BIG BANK,” he says:\n\nI said, ‘Bitch, I'ma do me’\nB.I.G., bitch everything zoomed-in (zoom)""]]), ('And they want me to stop but why would I stop?\n Huh?

In an industry where artists come and go quickly, Sean proudly boasts his longevity and success in the rap game.\n\nBecause of his success, Sean knows that there’s no reason for him to take his foot off the gas, which compels him to ask: “Why would I stop?”\n\n\n\nThe idiom “jump ship” means to quickly leave when things go wrong. Because of his fame and success, Big Sean is probably facing a lot of pressure to keep on producing quality work. If anybody else were faced with this same pressure, they would “jump”, just as someone may “jump ship”.\n\nHowever, because of Big Sean’s drive and work ethic, he chooses to “dive in it”, rather than jump. This indicates how Sean faces his problems head-on, and full of confidence because he knows he will come out on top. It’s because of this work ethic that he is still alive, referring to his actual life and his career’s longevity.']]), ('And I do this shit for the family (Straight up)\n Yeah, that’s just the roots I had planted (On God)', [['Building off the last few lines where he talks about having a family, Big Sean states that everything he does in his career and life is for his family.\n\nHe uses a metaphor to compare his family to the roots of a tree, which serve two functions: they provide nutrients for growth, and they provide support to hold the tree steady in place.\n\nHe also uses a homophone to establish a play on words, using the phrase “planned it”. Sean states this is just how he “planned it”, referring to making his family a priority in life. “Planned it” also sounds like “planted”, referring to Big Sean planting the seeds of success that will eventually turn into roots and then into a prosperous family tree.']]), ('Hero in my hood, when they dress like me, that’s cosplay', [['Big Sean acknowledges that he is looked up to in Detroit as a hero for all of the work and money he’s invested into his city.\n\nCosplay is a performance art in which participants wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character, usually superheroes. Being a hero in his hood of Detroit, there are going to be kids who look up to him and try to be him, like cosplayers.']]), ('I can’t be handin’ out samples (No way)\n I can’t be havin’ ten baby mamas\n That shit sound like a job, not a family (Straight up)', [['Big Sean is at a point in his life where he cannot keep fucking around with “lil ho’s” because he knows the consequences.\n\n“Handing out samples”, is a double entendre. The first meaning refers to having multiple partners, who each get a “sample”, or just a taste of what it would be like to be with Big Sean. The second meaning may refer to sperm, or children, because Big Sean does not want to give his seed (a sample of Big Sean himself) to just any woman.\n\nBy giving out these samples to multiple women, he will end up with multiple children. This does not sound like the ideal life for Sean, because he knows this will result in a lot of baby mama drama, child support claims, and hella stress.\n\nAlthough he will have multiple families, it is not the ideal family that he envisions. He wants his relationship to be authentic, and not “a job”, like it would feel like if he was dealing with multiple mothers and children.\n\n\n\nhttps://bckonline.com/2020/07/23/dmx-shouts-out-to-all-the-mothers-of-his-15-kids-during-verzuz-battle/']]), ('I’m at the point if I fuck with a lil’ ho\n It’s not just a fling, it’s a scandal (On God)', [['At this point in his career, Big Sean always has eyes on him. Because of this, media outlets like TMZ or The Shade Room are quick to make a scandal out of Sean’s relationship with any woman, whether it’s wife or side piece, for likes and views on their platform. This highlights just how far Big Sean has come, and how famous he is at this point in his career.\n\n\n\nIn a podcast episode of Broken Record with Rick Rubin, André 3000 states that he misses the days where he could just take a stroll in the city with a pretty lady. However, because of his fame, he can no longer do that without the internet blowing up with speculations and theories about who this woman may be, despite the fact that it’s not that serious to begin with. Big Sean now faces similar problems.']]), ('My dawg on the same way, the mode is attack', [['Being the first track off of Detroit 2, Big Sean is coming correct by being in “attack mode”, and he is playing offensively, not defensively. His “dawg” is the “same way”.\n\nSince “dawg” is slang for homie, Sean could be referring to his friend who is ready to take the offensive with Sean.\n\n“Dawg” could also refer to his pet (dog), who is ready to attack at any moment, like a guard dog.']]), ('This ain’t no walk in the park, you can’t slide', [['A “walk in the park” is a phrase that is usually meant to describe something as very easy and pleasant. To “slide” is slang for pulling up or coming through to see someone.\n\nIn this line, Big Sean employs a double entendre using the park imagery. Sean states that it will not be easy for his haters to get the drop on him (“walk in the park”) because he lays low. Thus, they won’t be able to “slide”, which also alludes to slides that are commonly found at park playgrounds.']]), ('I’m laying low, they could be espionage', [['Espionage is the act of obtaining secret / confidential information to use against one’s enemies. Big Sean is aware that because of his fame, there could be haters who are plotting on his downfall by taking his private information to use against him. Because of this, Sean decides to keep his life private for his own well-being.\n\nThis line is reminiscent of Big Sean’s 2016 track No More Interviews, where he raps about moving away from the limelight, in order to increase his focus on the music, his passions, and his family.\n\nhttps://genius.com/Big-sean-no-more-interviews-lyrics']])]","['WHAT A START 🔥🔥🔥', 'Too True Don', 'why would I stop! 🔥🔥🔥', 'Sean season finaly here🔥🔥', 'HOLY SHIT MAN THIS IS HOW YOU START AN ALBUM', 'Sean came swinging with this intro', 'Straight out the door banging ,the boy always had a crazy flow🔥🔥 I don’t complain about life I adapt', 'This is the best album of his discography so far, period.', 'The beat is on point.', 'This is straight up 🔥!!', 'AYYYYY SEAN BACK', 'Fire season boys I can feel this is gonna be a good album.', 'what a great intro😍🔥', 'I might leave the series, come back like I’m Robin 🥇', 'Gotdamn!!!!

They drop references to multiple R&B staples, including TLC, Keith Sweat, and SZA.

21 Savage has often expressed his love for R&B. He frequently covers songs by legendary and modern R&B artists on his Instagram story.

Metro Boomin provides a melodic instrumental built around a carnivalesque sample.","[('We in quarantine (On God), but my M’s long (On God)', [['When this song was released, the world was in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. This negatively affected the financial situations of millions of people around the world, particularly Americans. Initially, people were encouraged to quarantine themselves within their homes in an effort to hopefully protect them and others from contracting the virus.\n\nEntertainers, like Savage, were forced to postpone or cancel their concerts and tours due to regulations restricting or prohibiting large gatherings of people. However, Savage indicates that these restrictions did not limit or stop his inflow of wealth. As of this song’s release, Savage’s net worth is approximated at over $12 million and is still growing.\n\nMoreover, Savage is the sole owner of his masters, allowing him to control a variety of financial and business situations involving his music or likeness.']]), ('Put you in Chanel, I’ma teach you how to stunt (21)', [[""Chanel is a luxurious French brand that sells expensive clothes and fashion accessories. Savage mentions the brand in another SAVAGE MODE II track, “Rich Nigga Shit”:\n\nMy bitches be askin', “Where’s Chanel at?”\n\nSavage, himself, is often pictured wearing the brand:\n\n\n\nSavage wearing orange Chanel hip-tops""]]), ('I’ma slide anytime you want', [['“Slide,” in this context, means to meet with someone and have sex. Savage also used the term in a more literal way on his December 2018 song, “asmr”:\n\nSlide in and out (Out)\nSpend the night? I doubt (Doubt)']]), ('But she stay in apartments I got beef at (On God)\n Pussy so good, I had to sneak back (On God)\n Hit her with my Glizzy, boy, I keep that', [['“Glizzy” is slang for a Glock. A Glock is an Austrian made semi-automatic pistol that’s popular among many law enforcement and government agencies.\n\nThough Savage is making a correlation between his gun and his male genitalia, it connects with the other two lines; since he’s in enemy territory, he keeps a Glock for protection.']]), ('Threw my heart out the window, feelings gone (21)\n Threw my heart out the window, but', [[""Savage has rapped about not having a heart before on his July 2016 song, “No Heart”:\n\nI grew up in the streets without no heart\nI’m prayin' to my Glock and my carbon\n\nSavage being “heartless” likely comes from all of the violence and trauma he has endured over the years. His brother, Tayman, was killed in a botched drug deal, and on his 21st birthday, during an attempted robbery, his best friend, Johnny, was shot and killed. Savage was also shot six times.""]]), ('She want me to fuck her to some Keith Sweat (21)', [['Keith Sweat is an R&B singer who rose to fame in the late ‘80s. He has several top ten Billboard hits, all which includes his June 1996 song, “Nobody” and his September 1996 song, “Twisted.” Savage furthers the song’s theme of his girl wanting to make love to R&B music.\n\nSavage and Keith are friends: they did a RapCaviar sit-down together in November 2017 and appeared in a skit together.']]), ('Ayy, turn your phone off, take your clothes off (21)\n I’m a savage, but I fuck her to a slow song (21)\n Turn the lights down (21), lay the pipe down (21)\n I ain’t Mr. Right, but I’m Mr. Right Now (Straight up)', [['“Mr. Right” is what many females call the perfect guy and the one they want to marry. However, Savage doesn’t want any extra ties to this girl; he just wants sex. He made this clear in the February 2019 video version of “a lot,” where he raps about not wanting to be married:\n\nBe a married man, right now I just can’t']]), ('(Metro)', [['This is one of Metro Boomin’s many producer tags. This tag is voiced by Young Thug and comes from his November 2015 song, “Hercules.”\n\nThe tag, though rarely used, can be heard on songs like Gunna’s February 2018 song, “Car Sick,” and Nicki Minaj’s August 2018 song, “Chun Swae.”']]), ('While I jump inside that box and have a field day\n I’m the slow stroke king, hit me anytime\n And my goal is to get you to the finish line', [['“Box” is slang for a woman’s vagina and “have a field day” is an idiom that means to get pleasure from doing something—in this instance, having sexual intercourse.\n\nA “stroke” is an action that’s done during intercourse where a male enters, then nearly exits his partner in slow, repetitive motions. Drake previously mentioned the sexual move on the February 2019 remix of Summer Walker song, “Girls Need Love”:\n\nArched back, deep stroke\n\nLastly, Drake getting his girl to the “finish line” likely means he’s gonna make her orgasm.']]), ('Make that thing sing like Sade (21)', [['Sade is a Grammy-winning British band that’s named after their lead singer, Sade Adu. She’s known for her soulful ballads about love and loss. Additionally, she’s one of the most successful British female artists of all time and has had a big influence on contemporary music. Savage plays on “sing,” as it also means to shoot a weapon.\n\nNotably, Drake is a big fan of Sade; he sampled one of her songs on his September 2011 single, “Free Spirit,” and got two portraits of her tatted on his body in 2017.']])]","['me when I’m listening to this album:', '21, Drake and metro making numbers together again', 'WAIT DRAKE USED TO DATE SZA?????

Later, in August 2020, Mike WiLL Made-It previewed the song during an Instagram Livestream. Months after, Nicki Minaj announced the track’s November 2020 release via Instagram.

Furthermore, he should be banned from the United States FOREVER for intentionally trying to harm Megan the Stallion.\n\nInterestingly, July 27 landed on a Monday, and not a Thursday, in 2020.

We was in the trenches tryna get it out the mud
Lookin' up to killers tryna figure who I was
Sold the Richard Porter, I just wanna feel the love
I feel like a Crip 'cause I can't even trust my blood (Blood)
Loyalty (You know what loyalty is?), I say, ""Spoil me""
You ain't my dawg, you fallin' out about no lawyer fee (No lawyer fee)
You had a brick and I ain't even have a quarter key
You never seen my hand out, I knew it was more to me
It's more than us to see our sons and all our daughters eat
'Cause I got cops tryna lock me, opps out tryna slaughter me
But I stay prayed up, loadin' all these K's up
'Cause I ain't get advicе from all them nights back when I stayed up
Don't hit mе 'bout no show if you ain't come to set the stage up
We God body, threw a thousand shots, they barely grazed us
And I can't let 'em make my grave up

I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought that Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know the shit that I'm against, ayy

One nigga tellin' will take the gang away (The gang away)
Washin' blood with bleach don't wash the stain away (The stain away)
Seen my brother die, he died the strangest way (Stranger way)
Hangin' with the real, won't hang with lames today (Lames today)
Bein' counted out, I had to make a way (Make a way)
Snaked by one of my dawgs, I had to stay away (Stay away)
Millions dollar cash put up for a rainy day (Rainy day)
For a rainy
Durkio, I'm different with it (Different with it)
I praise the trenches like I ain't lose none of my niggas in it (Niggas in it)
I pray my daughter don't go through what I go with different women (Different women)
And I'm talking 'bout all the different niggas (Different niggas)
And I don't get these niggas (Get these niggas)
Why these niggas tryna hang like they ain't lynchin' niggas? (They ain't lynchin' niggas)
The opposition be sayin' my name, tryna get attention with it (Get attention with it)
I know an opp, he was suspect, now he a victim with it (Victim with it)

On “Pain Away,” Meek Mill talks about how he hopes his success and the money that comes with it might help to ease his pain caused by the violence and injustice he has seen in the world.  Despite the fact that his career has taken care of him and his family financially, he still feels obligated to use his money and his platform to help make the world a safer place.","[('Washin’ blood with bleach don’t wash the stain away', [['Bleach is a cleaning agent often used to clean and contaminate DNA evidence.

On September 30, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that will limit probation sentences in California.

Cudi flows in a never-before seen trio alongside the posthumous Brooklyn rapper Pop Smoke and London rapper Skepta. Produced by Cudi’s OG team of Dot Da Genius and Plain Pat (as well as Heavy Mellow and Gravez), Cudi returns to his roots both vocally and instrumentally.

Although Cudi is not known for a history of gang violence or drug dealing, he relates to the sentiments of Skepta and the late Pop Smoke through their dedication to their team and their cause.  The chorus depicts war-like behavior, pinning the rappers' teams against any enemies.
The verses continue this fighting theme through several mentions to the rappers' deep teams who stand by their respective leaders.","[('What’s it cost? Everything', [['Pretty sure this is an Infinity War reference.']]), ('Clip in the stick, stick in the coat (Boom)', [['“Clip in the stick” is slang for “ammo in the firearm”, meaning that the gun is loaded with ammunition.\n\n\n\nStick in the coat means that the “stick” aka a rifle is inside the coat.

It is Brooklyn drill’s favorite blunt wrap.\n\nIt had been referenced frequently in the drill rap sense.

This drug use, however, never got out of hand and he never endured lethal withdrawals. In 2006, after years of controlled drug use, Eminem sank into the depths of medication and codeine. The tortured rapper immersed himself in a willingly decadent rock and roll world in which a doomed artist can only live and be creative when in a chemically-induced trance.\n\nEminem was one of the lucky few to get out of the unhealthy, uncontrolled drug use. He is now over a decade sober and does not use prescription medication or codeine. He also advocates for drug-induced youth to get out of their addictions and sustain a sober lifestyle.\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first occasion when he would rap about overdosing on codeine. In the track “No Regrets” he refers to this subject once more:\n\nYeah, they miss the old me\nI think they want me to OD on codeine\nThey want my life in turmoil like in ‘03']]), ('Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine', [[""Chlorpromazine ,marketed under the brand name Thorazine among others, is an antipsychotic medication. It is primarily used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.\n\n\n\nMany modern psychiatrists believe that ‘'Marilyn Monroe’‘ was diagnosed with and suffered from all sorts of mood disorders like Paranoid, Schizophrenia and Borderline Personality Disorder symptoms of which include identity issues, addictive behavior, and suicidal behavior.\n\nMarilyn’s death was caused by an overdose of sedative drugs that was used to treat her mood disorders. Opiates are narcotic sedatives, hence the mention of heroin and morphine.\n\nThe word “heroin”  also could be interpreted as the word “heroine” describing Marilyn even further as she was a feminist icon, ergo a heroine to many.\n\nAlso the play on the words “Monroe” and “Heroin” is noticeable. Monroe is the largest city and county seat of Monroe County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Monroe is located approximately 14 miles (23 km) north of Toledo, Ohio and 25 miles (40 km) south of Detroit. it is a town which he visited years back.
