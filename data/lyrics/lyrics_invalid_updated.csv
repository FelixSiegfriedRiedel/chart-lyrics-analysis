And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon (Bitch, I'm back out...)

Yeah
To the left of that decimal, I need seven figures to play the joint
Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues, Lord, those images hauntin'
I ain't been asleep yet, it's ten in the mornin'
I'm sendin' a warnin', a problem with me is like the BET Hip-Hop Awards
I'm startin' to see you niggas don't want it
I'm sick of this flauntin', from niggas I know for sure ain't got mo' dough than Cole
Trash rappers, ass backwards, tryna go toe-to-toe
We laugh at ya, staff strapped up on top the totem pole to blast at ya
Bassmasters, look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon' for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code
Made a lil' tune called ""Foldin Clothes,"" and a nigga still ain't known to fold under pressure
Well, you know what Cole do
Make a diamond, they just rhymin', me, I'm quotin' gold
One phone call get you canceled like a homophobe in this PC culture
Address me as the G.O.A.T. like they call Chief Keef Sosa
In my sectional like a fuckin' three-piece sofa
I'm known as the chosen one
Another dead body lay frozen, that's how it go sometimes
When niggas weighin' coke and not the pros and cons
Well, I ain't with that sleepin' underground like a gopher, so I go for mines
Everything come back around full circle (Nigga, gotta go for mines)
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful? (Yeah)
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon (Yeah)

Survival at all costs, every day, niggas get logged off
Bodies get hauled off
Passin' a funeral procession while holdin' my breath in the car, I thought
At times, it be feelin' the devil be winnin' but do that mean God lost?
Just got off the phone with my nigga, he back in the kennel, my dog lost
I brought him 'round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be
I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind
It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries
My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency
Said, ""Most of these niggas gon' hang themselves, just give 'em the rope and see""
Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me
Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back
Unfortunately we seen the trap
Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly
They fiend to clap as often as the Genius app misquotin' me, uh
Meanwhile, I see that yo' diamonds is glistenin'
I'm glad that you shinin', but need I remind you my niggas is dimin' and nickelin'?
Scrapin' up whatever coin they can find, the pettiest crime, they committin' it
Just to get by for a limited time, the steepest of mountains, they tryin' to climb
I'm here tryna find the derivative, you niggas don't feel me
You see the clout, you don't see the real me
If I was sick, you niggas wouldn't heal me
Therefore I'm healin' myself, gettin' in tune with my God
Slowly revealin' myself, buildin' my wealth
A nigga touch mine, I'ma kill 'em myself, trust me
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon (Yeah)

Bitch, I'm back outside, nigga
I'm back outside
I'm back outside
I'm back outside
Everybody mentions suicide prevention
Man, they even made a hotline
To call up when there's tension, but I got a question
What about a fuckin' homicide?
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever there's a urge to get triggers involved
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever there's a urge to get triggers involved217EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/J-cole-t-h-e-c-l-i-m-b-b-a-c-k-lyrics,nan,j.

I was goin' through that pain alone
I was goin' through that phase alone
We all change, you say I change alone
Sleepless nights, barely changin' clothes
You know damn right you was wrong
I was tired, they didn't realize
Certain vibes, it don't feel right
Plenty nights got me traumatized
Why they lie? I do love my guys
You lookin' crazy, know the trenches raised me
I'm Durkio, but I'm Chicago JAY-Z
And I was scared how that money made me
I caught a vibe today, was lookin' crazy
Money ran low, right? Felons can't vote, right?
I can't even vote for who I believe in, shit ain't goin' right
I didn't drop a tear inside the funeral, I ain't mourn right
And I nut in all the hoes I fuck, I blame the porn site

Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate tryna turn away, tryna turn away
Became the voice of the streets and my people ain't believe in me
I'm supportive of the streets and them people ain't believe in me
Quarantine what? I'm just tryna make a buck
Talkin' to my dawg, he be actin' like he stuck
Favorite gun a Glock, it slipped up, what a month
Throw it in they face every time I hold it up
Granny ain't feelin' too well
Shootout with the police, I ain't goin' to jail
How you actin' off a case, you'll know if you tell
I know a nigga from the hood, he'll serve with no scale
Watchin' Bands make a play, I seen him score in the mail
Gave him thirty-nine years, I heard him cry in the cell
Even though I'm gettin' big, I bought a MAC through my Zelle
Took a picture on my block, they think I'm back in the field

Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate tryna turn away, tryna turn away

Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Shawty in love with my diamonds, she love how they twinkle
She love how they glisten and glow
Pour up a four like I'm young Tony Snow
One in the head, 99 more to go
Winnin' and winnin', pull up like a GOAT
Trippin', don't spill, that chinchilla on the floor
Came from the gutter, that's word from the bro

I'm really havin' more hits than The Beatles
I was out trappin' with keys like Alicia
I be finessin' my plug, got it cheaper
Bought some new killers, I bought some new choppers, hey
I'm on the block with the Devil, I hang with the robbers
Any hood we go, they treat me like God, huh
Switch up the flow for the visual
Just so you know that I'm spiritual
All of my money identical
Blue faces, blue faces, keep it one hundred

None of this bullshit was ever really worth it
You blame me like I know I ain't perfect
I tried with you, and I lied for you
Many times, put my life on the line for you
I really wanted to get it right with you
I always saw the better side of you
And now it's fuck you for life
I'm doin' better, you right
I was wrong 'bout you, I guess I finally realized
You brought the dark to my light
I'm with a new one tonight

Because I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind
Red in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet
I've been tryin' to feed my high
Your things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom
You'll leave, and I'm here
With no heart, guess I'll be dead soon
Ghost in a shell, stoned like a cemetery
Scars don't heal, I got these in February
Broke your spell, love is only temporary

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

""Merry Christmas"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you"", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Who give me something in return
I'll give it to someone—
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone—

Watch your back, watch your back
We can counter their attack
Hit 'em 'til the armor cracks

This could get a little sticky
How to win this battle could be tricky
But I know the best way, fall back, let me lead
You hold the line and we'll bring them to their knees
Swords in the air if you're with me
They got us outnumbered one to fifty
But victory is ours 'cause I got a strategy
You take the left and the rest of you can follow me (Uh-uh)
This is my crew
This is my squad
This is my turf
Oh my gosh
Look, guys, we've got bigger fish to fry
Put your differences aside
'Cause right now we're on the same side

Until the night falls, everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
We can counter their attack
Hit 'em 'til the armor cracks
Until the night falls, we're aligned
It doesn't mean that we're on the same side
Watch your back, watch your back
Watch your back, watch your back
Hit 'em hard and hit 'em fast
They're too heavy to react
This situation's getting kinda heavy
Hold your weapons tight, keep 'em steady
'Cause if we stick together, we can make it out alive
I'll cause a distraction, you attack them from the side
All my soldiers stand at the ready
We can cut 'em up like confetti
We'll hit 'em from the front, you counter from behind
Don't forget the fate of Auradon's on the line

This is all-out war, they got us outnumbered
The way the swords clash is the sound of the thunder
And we are not going under, we will never run for cover
We battle for the victory and ride for each other

Until the night falls, everyone
We'll stay together 'til the battle is done
Back to back, back to back
Back to back, back to back
We can counter their attack
Hit 'em 'til the armor cracks
Until the night falls, we're aligned
It doesn't mean that we're on the same side
Back to back, back to back
Back to back, back to back
Hit 'em hard and hit 'em fast
They're too heavy to react
Suit of armor strong and true
Make this metal bust a move!

Until the night falls, you can trust
I'm gonna help you win this battle because
I got your back, got your back
Got your back, got your back

I've been trying to let go, but it's powerful, it grips you
First, you think you got control until I see you, can't resist you
Know I got my issues, some I won't admit to

I swear all these helpin' hands ain't even helpful
Wishin' I was closer to you, wish you wasn't distant
Wishin' I was with you, still wish this shit was different
Wishin' we could travel back in time and we could switch it
All this pain, wishin' it was something that could fix it
Medicate myself, different substances, I mix it
Set my limits, try to draw the line and then she sniffs it
Never lied, I give you my word and then you twist it

Think the paparazzi flicked it (Think the paparazzi flicked it)

Where my young niggas choppin' up grams
And them choppers won't pry from they hands
Packin' lead like they got a exam
If it's beef, my niggas look just like homewreckers
They got they eye on your mans
I pray to God that it jam
Too many done died in these parts
So we gotta be smart if we tryna see August
Some niggas won't make it past summer regardless
I'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits
These niggas be lookin' at me like I got it
Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke
As that nigga who just graduated from college
Scrapin' up change that got left in my pockets
I'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar
Ridin' the train, way too shy to go holler
Just watched her get off at her stop, I'm a coward
Fuck it, though, you got a way bigger target
I'ma do it so big, they won't know what to call it
Sound like a whole Lambo' truck in my stomach
Bitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving
Gotta move mama from out them apartments
Gotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten
Gotta hit hoes you hang up in your locker
Gotta get rich, 'cause my granny picked cotton
Gotta make hits, 'cause if not, then I'm floppin'
Gotta stay me in the process
Niggas dissed me, it was nonsense
I sat 'em down like his father
My nigga asked, ""Why you bother?
We should've caught him and mobbed him""
I said, ""We gotta move smarter""
Don't wan' be the reason for one more sad song
I tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long
I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit, but they made they attempts
May have a good year like that name on the blimp
But you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price
Young Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God
Half the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?
But that's treacherous, that shows less of us
I need y'all to see every part of me
Every scar and every artery
Every story that I can recall, then I can fall

I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie

Thoughts when I was broke, if only I could be
Pockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me

Then found a better me, I got my head on straight

505,7758,J. Cole,J. Cole,Snow On Tha Bluff,2,54,"Niggas be thinkin' I'm deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some ""Fuck a retweet,"" most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, ""Wait""
He was like, ""Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real""
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today

Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe

Niggas hatin' on me 'cause I'm comin' up
Fuck you all night, we ain't gon' stop until the sun is up
Make you mine for a little
You should let me break your spine just a little
Got your shawty on my pistol, made her empty out the clip
I swear I'm too official, I could never stress a bitch
I done lost a couple soldiers, every day I reminisce
And I could've took his bitch, but her pussy smelled like fish
Me and all my niggas on the ship like marijuana
Only time a nigga hit my phone is when there's drama
Niggas feel a type of way 'cause I do what I wanna
While you was scared of sharks, I was posted with piranhas
I heard that you freaky, maybe you should teach me
I'm afraid to tell you how these other bitches treat me
Don't gotta worry, I'ma pull up when you need me
How my bitch bad is what I wonder like I'm Stevie

I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me

I swear to God you better never try to leave me
I want you to myself, I swear to God I'm greedy
I gotta move a type of way, no, it ain't easy
'Cause at the light is where these niggas tryna leave me
I gotta be cautious, these niggas like to talk shit
I remember when I pulled up on your shorty and she lost it
I was in the trenches, I was moving with them bosses
You was on the benches, you was dwelling over losses
I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me
I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me

Let me hold you
Girl, don't stress nobody
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me hold you
Girl, don't stress nobody
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on

I know it's been way too long

No need to say what I been through
He already know what I'm into
He be reading my mind like it’s simple
Got him banging my line like it's his too
Never gotta worry 'bout no issues
He pay it on time when the rent due
Made him ice out my neck and the wrist too
Hold down your pussy and your pistol (Let him know, girl)

Hair done, nails done like a bad bitch
Broke niggas turned me to a savage

Way more bad than your last bitch (Period)

I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

If we was, before we lost, we cheated
Hold up, they ain't made a game you can play on me
I just be prayin' for these niggas that they prey on me
They got another thing comin', homie, they gon' see
I got the blessings of an angel every day on me
Okay, church, nigga used to ask me where I'm from
Tell 'em Bankhead, nigga, but the earth my turf
Work, wonder what's up under my shirt
Wonder why I ain't gettin' searched
Nigga, TIP been solid, speak against his name in the hood
And you will get slapped out 'bout it
Had straps out wildin', but moments in the past
Just made me who I am, that's why I don't run from it
Keep it one hunnid', anyone who don't like it, then fuck 'em
Get a little money then double, level
Came a way from sellin' weed in the envelope
To Puff Daddy standin' with me in chinchilla
Road run, Rubber Band Man
Made a hundred mil' off of fifty grand man, well, goddamn

I done put it all on the line, I knew that the rent was due
Hard to go and get it, no trippin', it wasn't no handouts
Corner store got hot, we start sellin' 'em out my man house
We ain't never have nothin', stay pullin' bands out
I been runnin' it up and I heard he ran out
Know these pussy niggas wishin' shit would fan out, it won't
""How you make the gun go on safety?"" It don't
""You that young turnt nigga, Baby?"" For shit, sure
Never in my feelings 'bout a broad, she can hit, bro

Yawn, did this so long, it's gettin' borin'
Tapped into the culture, made a motherfuckin' lifestyle
Shoutout to my niggas doin' trap music right now
And you know we ain't with the hype, million on the mic
Get to switchin' out a queen just 'cause she ain't what we like, ay
I'm a king, done my thing from the green to the white
When you finished with opinions, I got four or five classics
Say I ain't the shit, that nigga must be dippin' acid
Fuck what all them other niggas doin', all I know is keep goin'
Start gettin' money, enjoyed it
Started sellin' crack for employment
Make it out of Georgia, that was a nigga only intent
Get them suckas out the way and get rich
Blockin' my path, boy, the .40 cal start barkin'
Like my nigga DMX in this bitch
I'm a vet at this shit, and all I ever been was authentic
Twenty years, I been handlin' my business
Get in my bag, stackin' my pennies

That car crash couldn't take me (Woo, ha)
Green haired angels all around me (Uh)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)
That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the...

Light
I see the light
You never wanna meet a motherfucker like me
I see the light (I said)
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it55EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Tyler-the-creator-whats-good-lyrics,tyler,"tyler,"

I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough

You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me

떠나야만 했어
난 찾아내야 했어
All day, all night
사막과 바다들을 건너
넓고 넓은 세계를
헤매어 다녔어
Baby, I

I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
그 먼 길 위에서
Oh you're the light
초대받지 못한
환영받지 못한
나를 알아줬던 단 한 사람

끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh-oh, I can make it right
All right

Oh-oh, I can make it right

Oh-oh, I can make it right

이 세상 속에 영웅이 된 나
나를 찾는 큰 환호와
내 손, 트로피와 금빛 마이크
All day, everywhere
But 모든 게 너에게 닿기 위함인 걸
내 여정의 답인 걸
널 찾기 위해 노래해
Baby, to you

전보다 조금 더 커진 키에
좀 더 단단해진 목소리에
모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게
My rehab
날 봐 왜 못 알아봐
남들의 아우성 따위 나 듣고 싶지 않아
너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로
Baby, I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
그 모든 길은 널
향한 거야
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
그때처럼 날 어루만져줘

끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh-oh, I can make it right

All right
All right
Oh-oh, I can make it right
All right

Oh-oh, I can make it right

여전히 아름다운 너
그날의 그때처럼 말없이 그냥 날 안아줘
지옥에서 내가 살아 남은 건
날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과 같을 거란 걸 알아

I can hold you tighter

Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy

Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh

Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string

I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)

'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires
Ayy
Self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's a ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from, they serve the soda clean (Clean, clean)
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it

I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires
Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, should've stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Déjà vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Déjà vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Déjà vu, déjà
Déjà

Alright, so unfortunately, I'm still here (Hahaha)
But, you know, if you're here, it's still up
In the building
And you just wanna hear some chune, some music
I think, you know, you found the right spot
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT

Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo

Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, ""Babe, I think there was a typo""
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls

And they wanna know what you're about

I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing

Never been swayed by color or skin shades

Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns

I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
For sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit

Shoulda never made a response, shoulda just aimed for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (Yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion

All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules

I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice

You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn

Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' all for coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '9-6, worse nightmare to side chicks, some things are just meant to be
This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
Segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

Never sold dope for no gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit, bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let up, treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping ""Fuck Da Police"" while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn

393,5660,Eminem Featuring Skylar Grey,Eminem,Leaving Heaven,1,61,"Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (Yeah)

Five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (Yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned, been
Countless times I've been doubted
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em
My God, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil
I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving Heaven (Fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know what? Maybe if I hadn't had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where I am going (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me, haha)

So you better, you better run (Yeah)
You better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
You better, you better run (Cocksucker, haha)
You better, you better run (See you in Hell)77EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Eminem-leaving-heaven-lyrics,genius,eminem

M.A

I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it, uh
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
It's the broke lingo (Huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (Hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (Hello)
Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up, Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (Hey)
When the pain leaves (Huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed
Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop
Please, dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple, I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating
Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z (Woo)
And I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah)
And the doctor's operating (What?)
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot to Shady
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal, that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away

Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors

One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for the homies in the chow hall (Whoa)
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

Kidnap a nigga like ISIS (Whoa)
Turn a whole world to a crisis (Whoa)
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo!)
Beat the police with a nightstick (Boop)
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk (Woo! Whoa)
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out (Whoa)
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house (Whoa)
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch (Whoa)
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out (Whoa)

Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? (Whoa)
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin
I ain't settlin' for nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' (Bop)

I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven (Bop, bop, brrrap, brap)
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? (Woo!)
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties (Whoa)
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine (Joyner)
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time (Woo!)
We do not share the same bloodline (No)
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time (Woo!)
According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious

One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)

Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw

What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, then you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS (ISIS)
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit (Body this shit)
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy, you pussy
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton

And 5'9"" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we sealed the game's doom
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo!
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!

Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy

When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme

Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...

But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school ""He's cool, he's not"" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em

Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said ""Rover"" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards

I read those texts that you sent to yours, but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say—)

You walked in my life at 2 AM
'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said
Now we're in the backseat of the black car, goin' home
When she asked me, ""Is it wrong if I come up with you?""
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kissed you for the first time in New York City, uh

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)

First off, I'm not sorry, I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible, girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me, you text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothing to do between you and me
Please don't say nothin', it all sounds so true to me
We don't got nothin' to say, hey
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it (I can't get enough of you)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love (In love)

Invisible set, diamonds huggin' my piece
Book me for a show, I need eighty at least
I want the smoke, ain't no keepin' the peace
Keep me a razor when I'm in the East
Open 'em up just like a surgery
Everything burnin' around me, I'm lit
Show a lil' attitude, swap out the bitch
I spent two-fifty, don't know where it went
My hood on my back, I gotta represent
Toronto, you useless, you don't got a pole

Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby

Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase

Line his ass up like a barber do the fade (Barber do the fade)

Cuatro abrazos y un café
Apenas me desperté
Y al mirarte recordé
Que ya todo lo encontré
Tu mano en mi mano
De todo escapamos
Juntos ver el sol caer
(Let them enjoy the paradise)

Vamos pa' la playa, pa’ curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres busca bullas y me gusta

Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento

Y aprovecha que el sol 'tá caliente y vamo' a disfrutar el ambiente
Vámono’ a meternos pa'l agua pa' que veas qué rico se siente
Y vámono' en tropical, por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro paramo' a darno' una Medalla
Bien fría, pa' bajar la sequía
Un poco de Bob Marley y unos trago’ ’e sangría
Pa' que te sueltes, poco a poquito
Porque pa’ vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico
Y dale lento, date un shot de Coquito
Y como dice Fonsi, vamo' a darle despacito (Ya, ya, ya)
Pa' que te suelte', poco a poquito
Porque pa’ vacilar no hay que salir de Puerto Rico (Laramercy gang)
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres busca bullas
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, baby, tú estás dura y me gusta

Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento
Lento y contento, cara al vie-ento

Farru, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Y darle lento, métele violento
Te puse reggaetón pa' que me apague' ese cuerpo
Métele hasta abajo, está duro ese movimiento
El único testigo que tenemos aquí e' el viento
Y dale, métele cintura, mátame con tu hermosura
Mira cómo me frontea porque sabe que está dura

Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos andando
Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si andamos juntitos bailando
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres busca bullas
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma

Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even

Said you'd die, said you'd die
But you lied, you lied to me

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
Your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)

Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me

I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me

With the winter wolves, in the dark, alone
The wildest night, I became the one
And you'll know you're mine when the silence comes

Heavy is the crown only for the weak

A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down
'Cause power is power, my fire never goes out
I rise from my scars, nothing hurts me now
'Cause power is power
Now watch me burn it down

I been down with the coldest war
And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?

Only love could kill me, God bless

So swamped by high water, keep your head up, you might drown
In this world, it's way colder, by the day, we count it down
Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase

Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it

The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure

But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-coney-island-lyrics,genius,taylor

There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick (Ooo)
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick (Ooo)
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel (Ooo)
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel (Ooo)

He don't miss no one
And hauling through the snow at a frightening speed (Ooo)
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead (Ooo)
He's gotta wear his goggles because the snow really flies (Ooo)
And he's cruising every pad with a little surprise (Ooo)

God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
But God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows

There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love
There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love

God only knows where to find you
God only knows how to break through
God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",https://genius.com/For-king-and-country-god-only-knows-lyrics,nan,for

Need you, tell me

Panic on the brain, world has gone insane
Things are starting to get heavy, mm
I can't help but think I haven't felt this way
Since I asked you to go steady

Wonderin' would you be my little quarantine?
Or is this the way it ends?

'Cause I told you my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
And you could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay

Panic on the brain, Michael's gone insane
Julie starts to make me nervous
I don't really care what they would say
I'm asking you to stay
In my bunker underneath the surface
Wonderin' would you be (Would you be)
My little quarantine? (Quarantine)
Or is this the way it ends?

'Cause I told you my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
And you could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah

Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah
Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah

'Cause I told you my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
You could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
I need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
I need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Need you now
I need you now
'Cause I told you my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
And you could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah

Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah
Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
You could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay, yeah

In a world where you could just lie to me (Need you)
And I'd be okay, we'll be okay (Level of concern)
We're gonna be okay (Just need you to tell me we're alright)
Tell me we're okay, I need you
Need you, tell me
