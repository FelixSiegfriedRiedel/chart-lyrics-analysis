Realmente tuve un problema con la música de C. Tangana este año, y  XXXTENTACION ,  Kinder Malo  y  Lil Peep  siguen estando en mi top 5 de artistas más oídos por segundo año consecutivo; no sé cómo ""Trap Latino"" llegó a ser mi género más escuchado xdd. Además, este año me adentré bastante a la música de  Rojuu , y gracias a que me suscribí a Spotify Premium este año logré subir mi número de minutos escuchado considerablemente. 😏 Puedes ver la imagen con mayor calidad cliqueando  aquí . 🔙 Trabajos anteriores al 2020 escuchados 🔙 Y por último, un pequeño tributo a los álbumes, mixtapes o EP que salieron antes de 2020, pero que les di una oportunidad este año. Solo diré una cosa: este año he escuchado muuuchos trabajos anteriores a 2020; me he puesto al corriente y he ampliado mis gustos musicales a otros géneros musicales no tan comunes en mí, como debe ser. 😉 • Lil Bo Weep  -  SOLOS  (2017) • Go Golden Junk -  Golden Junk  (2018) • C.

Was I reckless to help? Was it obvious to everybody else?  That I'd fallen for a lie You were never on my side Fool me once, fool me twice Are you death or paradise? Now you'll never see me cry There's just no time to die  I let it burn You're no longer my concern, mmm Faces from my past return Another lesson yet to learn  That I'd fallen for a lie You were never on my side Fool me once, fool me twice Are you death or paradise? Now you'll never see me cry There's just no time to die  No time to die, mmm No time to die, ooh  Fool me once, fool me twice Are you death or paradise?

Ha Get my pretty name out of your mouth We are not the same with or without Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel Top of the world, but your world isn't real Your world's an ideal  So go have fun I really couldn't care less And you can give 'em my best, but just know  I'm not your friend Or anything, damn You think that you're the man I think, therefore, I am I'm not your friend Or anything, damn You think that you're the man I think, therefore, I am  I don't want press to put your name next to mine We're on different lines, so I Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff 'Cause I hate to find Articles, articles, articles Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta) Interviews, interviews, interviews When they say your name, I just act confused  Did you have fun? I really couldn't care less And you can give 'em my best, but just know  I'm not your friend Or anything, damn You think that you're the man I think, therefore, I am I'm not your friend Or anything, damn You think that you're the man I think, therefore, I am  I'm sorry I don't think I caught your name I'm sorry I don't think I caught your name  I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend) Or anything, damn You think that you're the man (They wanna, they can try) I think, therefore, I am (I am) I'm not your friend (Friend) Or anything, damn (They wanna) You think that you're the man (You're the man) I think, therefore, I am (Therefore, I am)"

Вот тогда тебе бессоница У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня Чел, выпей коньяка Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить Во мне...  Монстра Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра При свете луны, что сияет так ясно Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол  Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех.

Горю, как у лжеца память Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк Называй меня Дидди Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров Будто я буду щас стрелять всех Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их Теперь пришло время их всех положить! Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их И перемалываю в ярости Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон И я знаю, он по крови их голоден Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя И раскидаю в разные стороны Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту Я разорву на куски тебя Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере Я не боюсь потянутся за моим... Чел стой Смотри что в планах! Хах"

And there's one more boy, he's from my past We fell in love, but it didn't last 'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you  All I want is love that lasts Is all I want too much to ask? Is it something wrong with me? All I want is a good guy Are my expectations far too high? Try my best, but what can I say? All I have is myself at the end of the day But shouldn't that be enough for me?  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh And I miss the days when I was young and naive I thought the perfect guy would come and find me Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily  All I want is love that lasts Is all I want too much to ask? Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh All I want is a good guy Are my expectations far too high? Try my best but what can I say? All I have is myself at the end of the day And all I want is for that to be okay"
