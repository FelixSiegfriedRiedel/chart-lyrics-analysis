0,"This world on fire
Feels like a bad dream
Did the hammer come down?
It feels like a kick in the teeth
All this down on my luck
Has been gettin' me down on my knees
It might have been something I need

'Cause I've been chasin, rat racin'
Doin' anything to win
Now my grass looks like Augusta
I got around to paintin' that fence
I've been callin' up my mama, doin' some old friend checkin' in
And it seems like where I'm going
Might be better than where I been
'Cause with all this goin' on
I found the right in all this wrong and I finally see
The good Lord knows better than me

I got a little less in the bank
But I get a little more sleep
I get a little more use
Out of that old porch swing
I got a little more her
Holdin' on to a little more me
I feel a little more free

'Cause I've been chasin, rat racin'
Doin' anything to win
Now my grass looks like Augusta
I got around to paintin' that fence
I've been callin' up my mama, doin' some old friend checkin' in
And it seems like where I'm going
Might be better than where I been
'Cause with all this goin' on
I found the right in all this wrong and I finally see
The good Lord knows better than me
Knows better than me

If the world does end
I'll take the last day slow
And if He does come back
I know where I'll go
And if He takes His time
Well, I've learned one thing
The good Lord knows better than me

'Cause I've been chasin, rat racin'
Doin' anything to win
I've made more time for fishin'
I got my old truck runnin' again
I went home to see my mama, been good hearing from old friends
And it seems like where I'm going
Might be better than where I been
'Cause with all this goin' on
I found the writin' on the wall and I finally see
The good Lord knows better than me

Better than me
So much better than me",True

What is happening?

Yes the world is in a slumber
Full of hopeless things

Is there anybody listening?
You gotta keep the faith

All the hurt that hinders
It will fade away

But I know someone who’ll comfort you

And when your hope is gone he will bring you through

If we come together hand and hand
We can make a difference if we stand
I believe I believe we will
I believe I believe we can
If we learn to take our trust from man
And just put it all in Gods hands
I believe I believe he will
I believe I believe we can

God has not given us a spirit of fear but a power of love and a sound mind

Famine and diseases
The only plague our land today

Violence that is needless
Cause there is so much hate

There are many questions
That often take place

Searching for an answer
But we must keep the faith

But I know someone who’ll comfort you

And when your hope is gone he will see you through

If we come together hand and hand
We can make a difference if we stand
I believe I believe we will
I believe I believe we can
If we learn to take our trust from man
And just put it all in Gods hands

Now I don’t know about you but I believe in a God who can use this
I believe the children still the future
I believe a God who renews us
I believe if He parted seas, this disease gotta bow to the ruler!

So many are constantly dying
From the hand of disease
Taking breath from their bodies alone

It’s time to let them see
We can make it if we can see
There will be better days if we just believe

Hope’s not gone

So keep holding on

Yes we have to keep the faith
